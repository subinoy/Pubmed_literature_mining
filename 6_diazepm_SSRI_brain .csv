Seven groups of mice (12-15 g each) were administered distilled water (DW) (non-stressed and stressed controls)  sertraline (10 mg/kg)  diazepam (2 mg/kg) or one of three doses of melatonin (5  10 and 15 mg/kg). Mice were exposed to 30 min of chronic mild stress (25 min of cage shaking  cage tilting  handling and 5 min of forced swimming in tepid warm water at 25 °C  in a random order) after administration of DW or drugs  daily for 21 days. Behavioural assessments were conducted on day 1 and day 21 (after which mice were sacrificed  blood taken for estimation of corticosterone levels and brain homogenates used for estimation of antioxidant activities). Administration of melatonin resulted in an increase in horizontal locomotion and self-grooming  while rearing showed a time-dependent increase  compared to non-stress and stress controls. Working memory improved with increasing doses of melatonin (compared to controls and diazepam); in comparison to setraline however  working memory decreased. A dose-related anxiolytic effect is seen when melatonin is compared to non-stressed and stressed controls. Melatonin administration reduced the systemic/oxidant response to repeated stress. Administration of melatonin in repeatedly stressed adolescent mice was associated with improved central excitation  enhancement of working memory  anxiolysis and reduced systemic response to stress."

The underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully defined. Because of its effects on the cytochrome P450 system (CYP450)  we hypothesized that neuroprotection by fluoxetine is related to altered metabolism of retinoic acid (RA)  whose CYP450-mediated degradation in brain tissue constitutes an important step in the regulation of its site-specific auto- and paracrine actions. Using traditional pharmacological in vitro assays  the effects of fluoxetine on RA degradation were probed in crude synaptosomes from rat brain and human-derived SH-SY5Y cells  and in cultures of neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore  retinoid-dependent effects of fluoxetine on neuronal survival following glutamate exposure were investigated in rat primary neurons cells using specific retinoid receptor antagonists. Experiments revealed dose-dependent inhibition of synaptosomal RA degradation by fluoxetine along with dose-dependent increases in RA levels in cell cultures. Furthermore  fluoxetine's neuroprotective effects against glutamate excitotoxicity in rat primary neurons were demonstrated to partially depend on RA signaling. Taken together  these findings demonstrate for the first time that the potent  pleiotropic antidepressant fluoxetine directly interacts with RA homeostasis in brain tissue  thereby exerting its neuroprotective effects."

However  little is known about the involvement of this system in the panicolytic property also exerted by these compounds. In the present study we evaluated the participation of the BDNF-TRKB system of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG)  a core structure involved in the pathophysiology of panic disorder  in AD-induced panicolytic-like effects in rats. The results showed that short- (3 days) or long-term (21 days) systemic treatment with the tricyclic ADs imipramine  clomipramine or desipramine increased BDNF levels in the DPAG. Only longterm treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine was able to increase BDNF levels in this structure. After 21-day treatment  fluoxetine and the three tricyclic ADs used also increased BDNF concentration in the hippocampus  a key area implicated in their mood-related actions. Neither in the DPAG nor hippocampus did long-term treatment with the standard anxiolytics diazepam  clonazepam or buspirone affect BDNF levels. Imipramine  both after short and long-term administration  and fluoxetine under the latter regimen  raised the levels of phosphorylated TRKB in the DPAG. Short-term treatment with imipramine or BDNF microinjection inhibited escape expression in rats exposed to the elevated T maze  considered as a panicolytic-like effect. This anti-escape effect was attenuated by the intra-DPAG administration of the TRK receptor antagonist k252a. Altogether  our data suggests that facilitation of the BDNF-TRKB system in the DPAG is implicated in the panicolytic effect of ADs."

AP521 showed equal or more potent anxiolytic-like effects compared with diazepam  a benzodiazepine receptor agonist  or tandospirone  a partial 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptor agonist  in three rat anxiety models; the Vogel-type conflict test  elevated plus maze test  and conditioned fear stress test. Although AP521 did not bind to the benzodiazepine receptor  it did bind to 5-HT1A  5-HT1B  5-HT1D  5-HT5A and 5-HT7 receptors  and showed agonist activity for the human 5-HT1A receptor expressed in HEK293 cells. Tandospirone  which can stimulate the presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the raphe  tended to decrease extracellular 5-HT concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in rats. In contrast  AP521 increased extracellular 5-HT concentration. In addition  AP521 enhanced the anti-freezing effect of citalopram  a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  in the fear conditioning model in rats and enhanced the citalopram-caused increase of the extracellular 5-HT concentration in the mPFC. These results suggest that AP521 exhibits potent anxiolytic effects by acting as a postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor agonist and by enhancing serotonergic neural transmission in the mPFC by a novel mechanism of action."

These drugs include alprazolam (Xanax)  diazepam (Valium)  clonazepam (Klonopin)  and others. There are two distinct types of pharmacological binding sites for benzodiazepines in the brain (BZ1 and BZ2)  these sites are on GABA-A receptors  and are classified as short  intermediate  or long-acting. From the thienobenzodiazepine class (TBZ)  Olanzapine (2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-l-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno[2 3-b][1 5]benzodiazepine) (Zyprexa) was used as an example to demonstrate the antagonism of this class of compounds for multiples receptors including: dopamine D1-D5  a-adrenoreceptor  histamine H1  muscarinic M1-M5 and 5-HT2A  5-HT2B  5-HT2C  5-HT3 and 5-HT6 receptors. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent  structurally related to clozapine  and extensively used for the treatment of schizophrenia  bipolar disorder-associated mania  and the behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. The functional blockade of these multiple receptors contributes to the wide range of its pharmacologic and therapeutic activities  having relatively few side effects when compared to other antipsychotics agents. Thienobenzodiazepines (such as Olanzapine) are characterized as multi- receptor- targeted- acting- agents. This mini-review discusses these 2 drug classes that act on the central nervous system  the main active compounds used  and the various receptors with which they interact. In addition  we propose 12 olanzapine analogues  and generated Random Forest models  from a data set obtained from the ChEMBL database  to classify the structures as active or inactive against 5 dopamine receptors (D1  D2  D3  D4  D5 and D6)  and dopamine transporter."
"6","25590967","Fluvoxamine alleviates seizure activity and downregulates hippocampal GAP-43 expression in pentylenetetrazole-kindled mice: role of 5-HT3 receptors.","Epilepsy has been documented to lead to many changes in the nervous system including cell loss and mossy fiber sprouting. Neuronal loss and aberrant neuroplastic changes in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus have been identified in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling model. Antiseizure activity of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has been reported in several studies. In the current study  the protective effect of fluvoxamine against PTZ-kindling was investigated in terms of seizure scores  neuronal loss  and regulation of hippocampal neuroplasticity. Further  the role of 5-HT3 receptors was determined. Kindling was induced by repeated injections of PTZ (35<U+2009>mg/kg) thrice weekly  for a total of 13 injections. One hundred male albino mice were allocated into 10 groups: (1) saline  (2) PTZ  (3) diazepam (1<U+2009>mg/kg)+PTZ  (4-6) fluvoxamine (5  10 or 20<U+2009>mg/kg)+PTZ  (7) ondansetron+fluvoxamine (20<U+2009>mg/kg)+PTZ  (8) ondansetron+PTZ group  (9) ondansetron (2<U+2009>mg/kg  i.p.)+saline  and (10) fluvoxamine (20<U+2009>mg/kg)+saline. PTZ-kindled mice showed high seizure activity  hippocampal neuronal loss  and expression of growth-associated phosphoprotein (GAP-43) compared with saline-treated mice. Repeated administration of fluvoxamine (20<U+2009>mg/kg) in PTZ-kindled mice suppressed seizure scores  protected against hippocampal neuronal loss  and downregulated GAP-43 expression  without producing any signs of the 5-HT syndrome in healthy rats. Importantly  pretreatment with a selective 5-HT3 receptor blocker (ondansetron) attenuated the aforementioned effects of fluvoxamine. In conclusion  the ameliorating effect of fluvoxamine on hippocampal neurons and neuroplasticity in PTZ-kindled mice was  at least in part  dependent on enhancement of hippocampal serotoninergic transmission at 5-HT3 receptors."
"7","24920136","Plurality of anxiety and depression alteration mechanism by oleanolic acid.","Our study sought to evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant activities of oleanolic acid as well as the neural mechanisms involved. Animal models such as barbiturate sleep-induction  light-dark box  elevated plus maze  forced swimming test  tail suspension test and open field test were conducted. Male Albino Swiss mice were treated orally with vehicle 10 mL/kg  fluoxetine 20 mg/kg  imipramine 15 mg/kg  diazepam 1 mg/kg or oleanolic acid 5-40 mg/kg. Pretreatment (intraperitoneal) of animals with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) 20 mg/kg  1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4- (2-phthalimido) butyl]piperazine hydrobromide (NAN-190) 0.5 mg/kg  p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA) 100 mg/kg or a-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) 100 mg/kg  WAY100635 (WAY) 0.3 mg/kg  prazosin (PRAZ) 1 mg/kg  yohimbine 2 mg/kg as well as monoamine oxidase assay and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) quantification were carried out. Oleanolic acid potentiated the hypnotic effect of barbiturate and demonstrated an anxiolytic effect in both the light-dark box and elevated plus maze. This effect was not reversed by PTZ. Acute and/or chronic oral treatment of mice with oleanolic acid (5-20 mg/kg) elicited an antidepressant effect in the forced swimming test and the tail suspension test without interfering with the locomotor activity. The antidepressant effect of oleanolic acid was attenuated by NAN-190  AMPT  PCPA  WAY and PRAZ. Although monoamine oxidase activity remained unaltered by oleanolic acid  chronic administration of oleanolic acid augmented hippocampal BDNF level. These findings demonstrate multiple mechanisms of the anxiolytic and antidepressant effect of oleanolic acid."
"8","23982114","The organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) as molecular target of psychotropic drugs: transport characteristics and acute regulation of cloned murine OCT3.","The organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) is a widely expressed transporter for endogenous and exogenous organic cations. Of particular interest is OCT3 expression and function in the brain  where it plays a role in serotonin clearance and influences mood and behavior. Protein kinase signaling mediates rapid modulation of cerebral processes  but little is known about acute regulation of OCT3 by protein kinases. Therefore  we cloned mouse OCT3 (mOCT3) and generated a human embryonic kidney cell line stably expressing the transporter to study transport characteristics  acute regulation by protein kinases  and interaction with psychotropic drugs. Uptake measurement was performed using the fluorescent cation 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (ASP(+)  1 µM) as a substrate. The translational value of these findings was determined by comparing results obtained with cloned mouse and human OCT3. mOCT3-mediated transport is membrane potential dependent and pH independent. ASP(+) uptake by mOCT3 and human OCT3 (hOCT3) was efficiently inhibited by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium  tetrapentylammonium (TPA(+))  corticosterone  serotonin  and histamine and by the drugs ketamine  fluoxetine  and diazepam. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations of mOCT3 and hOCT3 for TPA(+)  serotonin  diazepam  and ketamine are significantly different. Diazepam is a non-transported inhibitor. Furthermore  the activities of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are acutely regulated by the p56 (lck) tyrosine kinase by decreasing their V max. Studies with freshly isolated renal proximal tubules from mOCT1/2(-/-) mice  in which mOCT3 is the only OCT present  confirmed this regulation pathway. Only the activity of hOCT3 is regulated by calmodulin. These findings suggest that even though many transport properties of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are similar  there are also species-specific aspects of OCT3 function."
"9","23639432","A benzodiazepine impairs the neurogenic and behavioural effects of fluoxetine in a rodent model of chronic stress.","Antidepressant agents such as fluoxetine have been shown to produce neurogenic effects involving transcriptional and translational changes that direct molecular and cellular plasticity. These cellular and molecular events appear necessary to mediate the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine and may be generated through the ability for fluoxetine to regulate BDNF levels. Clinically  benzodiazepines are frequently used in combination with standard antidepressants both for initial treatment and maintenance therapy  especially when comorbid anxiety is present. However  very little is known regarding the consequence of combined treatment of benzodiazepines and antidepressant on the development of clinical effect. The current study therefore examined the effect of co-administration of fluoxetine and the benzodiazepine  diazepam  on hippocampal neurogenesis in the social isolation rodent model of chronic stress. We demonstrate that 9 weeks of social isolation induces a deficit in motivational behaviour with increased anxiety as well as impairment in hippocampal neurogenesis. This was parallelled by reduced BDNF levels in the hippocampus. While treatment with fluoxetine alone for 3 weeks restored anxiety behaviour as well as progenitor cell proliferation and the generation of new hippocampal neurons  this effect was prevented by co-administration with diazepam. This suggests that co-administering benzodiazepines with antidepressants could significantly delay or prevent the cellular and behavioural improvement needed by patients. These findings indicate the need for future clinical studies designed to investigate the combined effects of benzodiazepines and antidepressants in patients."
"10","23470900","Ethopharmacological analysis of the open elevated plus-maze in mice.","Exposure of rodents to an open elevated plus-maze (oEPM) elicits antinociception and increases plasma corticosterone levels. However  no studies have yet assessed the defensive behaviour repertoire of animals in this modified test. In Experiment 1  factor analysis was employed to characterise the behavioural profile of mice exposed to the oEPM. Experiments 2 and 3 assessed the effects of acute alprazolam (0.5-1.5mg/kg; diazepam 0.5-1.5mg/kg)  pentylenetetrazole (10.0-30.0mg/kg)  yohimbine (2.0-6.0mg/kg)  mCPP (0.3-3.0mg/kg)  and acute and chronic fluoxetine (10.0-30.0mg/kg) and imipramine (1.0-15.0mg/kg) on behaviours identified in Experiment 1. The factor analyses revealed that behaviour in the oEPM can largely (77% total variance) be accounted for in terms of 3 factors: factor 1 ('depth exploration'; e.g. head-dipping on the arms)  factor 2 ('cautious exploration of arms'; e.g. flatback approach)  and factor 3 ('risk assessment'; stretched attend postures - SAP). Experiments 2 and 3 showed that  over the dose range used  alprazolam selectively attenuated all measures of defensiveness. Similar  though more modest  effects were seen with diazepam. Confirming the intensity of the emotional response to the oEPM (nociceptive  endocrine and behavioural)  relatively few significant behavioural changes were seen in response to the anxiogenic compounds tested. Although acute fluoxetine or imipramine treatment failed to modify behaviour in the oEPM  chronic fluoxetine (but not chronic imipramine) attenuated total flat back approach and increased head dipping outside the central square. Together  the results indicate that the oEPM induces behavioural defensive responses that are sensitive to alprazolam and chronic fluoxetine."
"11","22641177","An affective disorder in zebrafish with mutation of the glucocorticoid receptor.","Upon binding of cortisol  the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates the transcription of specific target genes  including those that encode the stress hormones corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Dysregulation of the stress axis is a hallmark of major depression in human patients. However  it is still unclear how glucocorticoid signaling is linked to affective disorders. We identified an adult-viable zebrafish mutant in which the negative feedback on the stress response is disrupted  due to abolition of all transcriptional activity of GR. As a consequence  cortisol is elevated  but unable to signal through GR. When placed into an unfamiliar aquarium ('novel tank')  mutant fish become immobile ('freeze')  show reduced exploratory behavior and do not habituate to this stressor upon repeated exposure. Addition of the antidepressant fluoxetine to the holding water and social interactions restore normal behavior  followed by a delayed correction of cortisol levels. Fluoxetine does not affect the overall transcription of CRH  the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)  the serotonin transporter (Serta) or GR itself. Fluoxetine  however  suppresses the stress-induced upregulation of MR and Serta in both wild-type fish and mutants. Our studies show a conserved  protective function of glucocorticoid signaling in the regulation of emotional behavior and reveal novel molecular aspects of how chronic stress impacts vertebrate brain physiology and behavior. Importantly  the zebrafish model opens up the possibility of high-throughput drug screens in search of new classes of antidepressants."
"12","22344744","Differential effects of diazepam, tandospirone, and paroxetine on plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor level under mental stress.","OBJECTIVES: Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are reduced in depressed patients  and successful antidepressant treatment leads to increases in BDNF levels. However  little is known about how psychotropic drugs affect the mechanism of the human response to mental stress. We investigated the influence of psychotropic drugs on plasma BDNF levels under mental stress using a driving simulator (DS) task.METHODS: Fourteen healthy male volunteers received one of four drugs  diazepam (5<U+2009>mg)  tandospirone (20<U+2009>mg)  paroxetine (10<U+2009>mg)  and matched placebo  in a double-blind  crossover manner. Subjects were asked to perform the DS task 4<U+2009>h post-dosing. Plasma BDNF levels were measured before and after the DS task.RESULTS: Plasma BDNF levels under the placebo  diazepam  and tandospirone conditions significantly decreased after the DS task compared with before the task. Conversely  no significant differences in plasma BDNF levels were detected under the paroxetine condition.CONCLUSION: As these three psychotropic drugs have differential effects on plasma BDNF levels under mental stress after 4<U+2009>h post-dosing  antidepressants  unlike anxiolytics  might have a prompt positive effect on the mental stress response."
"13","21907645","Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay for the quantification of four benzodiazepines and citalopram in eleven postmortem rabbit fluids and tissues, with application to animal and human samples.","Pharmacokinetic studies and postmortem toxicological investigations require a validated analytical technique to quantify drugs on a large number of matrices. Three-step liquid/liquid extraction with online derivatization (silylation) ahead of analysis by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated on rabbit specimens in order to quantify citalopram and 4 benzodiazepines (diazepam  nordazepam  oxazepam and temazepam) in 11 biological matrices (blood  urine  bile  vitreous humor  liver  kidney  skeletal muscle  brain  adipose tissue  bone marrow (BM) and lung). Since the 11 biological matrices came from the same animal species  full validation was performed on 1 matrix  bone marrow (considered the most complex)  while the other 10 underwent partial validation. Due to non-negligible matrix effects  calibration curves were performed on each matrix. Within-day and between-day precision (less than 12.0% and 12.6%  respectively) and accuracy (from 88.9% to 106.4%) were acceptable on BM at both low and high concentrations. Assessment on the other matrices confirmed accuracy and within-day precision (less than 12%  and generally between 85.1% and 114.5%  respectively). The lower limit of quantification of the method was 1ng/g for nordazepam  5ng/g for citalopram and 10ng/g for oxazepam  diazepam and temazepam. The combination of 3-step extraction and MS/MS detection provided good selectivity in all matrices  including the most lipid-rich. Application to real-case samples showed that the method was sensitive enough to describe distribution patterns in an animal experiment  and specific enough to detect molecules in highly putrefied samples from human postmortem cases."
"14","21835188","Magnesium deficiency induces anxiety and HPA axis dysregulation: modulation by therapeutic drug treatment.","Preclinical and some clinical studies suggest a relationship between perturbation in magnesium (Mg(2+)) homeostasis and pathological anxiety  although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Since there is evidence that Mg(2+) modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis  we tested whether enhanced anxiety-like behaviour can be reliably elicited by dietary Mg(2+) deficiency and whether Mg(2+) deficiency is associated with altered HPA axis function. Compared with controls  Mg(2+) deficient mice did indeed display enhanced anxiety-related behaviour in a battery of established anxiety tests. The enhanced anxiety-related behaviour of Mg(2+) deficient mice was sensitive to chronic desipramine treatment in the hyponeophagia test and to acute diazepam treatment in the open arm exposure test. Mg(2+) deficiency caused an increase in the transcription of the corticotropin releasing hormone in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN)  and elevated ACTH plasma levels  pointing to an enhanced set-point of the HPA axis. Chronic treatment with desipramine reversed the identified abnormalities of the stress axis. Functional mapping of neuronal activity using c-Fos revealed hyper-excitability in the PVN of anxious Mg(2+) deficient mice and its normalisation through diazepam treatment. Overall  the present findings demonstrate the robustness and validity of the Mg(2+) deficiency model as a mouse model of enhanced anxiety  showing sensitivity to treatment with anxiolytics and antidepressants. It is further suggested that dysregulations in the HPA axis may contribute to the hyper-emotionality in response to dietary induced hypomagnesaemia. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Anxiety and Depression'."
"15","21820452","Susceptibility to the long-term anxiogenic effects of an acute stressor is mediated by the activation of the glucocorticoid receptors.","The specificity of the response of an organism is an important variable influencing stress-related parameters and psychopathological states. We have shown that trait anxiety in C57BL/6 mice  determined by their emergence latencies in the free choice open field test  positively correlates with the long-term behavioral and neuroendocrinological changes induced by a stressor. Here  we show that this interindividual variability is caused by a different reactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis upon exposure to a stressor. Mice with high trait anxiety (long emergence latency  LEL) display a more pronounced stress-induced activation of the HPA axis than mice with low trait anxiety (short emergence latency  SEL). Moreover  stress-induced activation of tyrosine hydroxylase and corticotropin-releasing hormone occurred in LEL but not SEL mice. In search of the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences  we found that under non-stressed conditions mRNA and protein levels of the glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus were higher in LEL mice compared to SEL mice. Also  systemic injection of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 decreased the stress-induced activation of the HPA axis and the long-term anxiogenic effects of stress observed in LEL mice. Finally  the rewarding properties of cocaine were enhanced in LEL mice compared to SEL mice  suggesting a causal link between trait anxiety  stress activity and the behavioral responses to drugs of addiction."
"16","21333660","Characterization of 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mice: an animal model sensitive to anxiolytic treatments.","Selective serotonin (5-HT) re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in Humans. However  because only few animal models display overt anxious-like behavior  detailed preclinical studies of the anxiolytic properties of antidepressants are still lacking. Here  we studied the neurochemical and behavioral effects of a double 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor knockout in mice (5-HT(1A/1B)-/-) as compared to their wild-type littermates (5-HT(1A/1B)+/+). It is known that single deletion of either 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(1B) receptor induces behavioral changes that are not correlated with differences in brain serotonergic tone. Deletion of both receptors resulted in (i) higher emotionality of animals  as observed in three unconditioned paradigms of anxiety (open field  elevated plus maze and novelty suppressed feeding tests); (ii) a 200% increase in the mean spontaneous firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) compared to 5-HT(1A/1B)+/+ mice; (iii) elevated basal dialysate levels of 5-HT in the DRN and frontal cortex; (iv) an exaggerated response to acute paroxetine administration in microdialysis experiments  and (v) increased basal core body temperature. These findings suggest that the deletion of both autoreceptors induces a strong anxious-like behavioral state associated with increased 5-HT neurotransmission. Interestingly  5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mice are still sensitive to the acute administration of diazepam. Moreover  while deletion of both receptors impacted on the response to acute SSRI treatment in the forced swim test  anxiolytic-like effects of a chronic SSRI treatment were still observed in 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mice. Thus  the 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mouse model could be of great interest to unveil the mechanisms of action of the anxiolytic effects of SSRIs."
"17","20678516","Pharmacological evaluation of a novel assay for detecting glycine transporter 1 inhibitors and their antipsychotic potential.","Multiple lines of evidence support the notion that hypofunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Moreover  glycine and glycine modulators have beneficial effects in patients with schizophrenia  particularly when added on to existing therapy. As glycine is an obligatory co-agonist at the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor  blockade of glycine uptake at the glycine transporter type-1 (GlyT1) can enhance low glutamatergic tone. L-687 414 is an antagonist at the glycine modulatory site of the NMDA complex and  behaviorally  increases locomotion. A series of GlyT1 inhibitors along with other psychoactive compounds were examined for their ability to enhance or inhibit the action of L-687 414. GlyT1 inhibitors and the other compounds were examined initially for effects on [(3)H]-glycine uptake in CHO cells expressing hGlyT1b cDNA and for their ability to displace the NMDA-glycine site ligand [(3)H]-L-689 560 from isolated rat forebrain membrane preparations. The in vivo activity of these compounds was determined in mice by measuring their ability to prevent L-687 414-induced hyperlocomotion. GlyT1 inhibitors blocked [(3)H]-glycine uptake in cells expressing the human transporter; other compounds had little or no activity. None of the compounds had affinity for the glycine site of the NMDA receptor complex. Hyperlocomotion induced by L-687 414 was dose-dependently reduced by GlyT1 inhibitors and antipsychotic drugs but not by morphine  fluoxetine or a moderate dose of diazepam. Therefore  this behavioral approach can reliably detect GlyT1 inhibitors which  in turn  may have some activity in common with drugs having antipsychotic effects."

These agents are routinely used in the symptomatic treatment of neurodegenerative disease.

Effects on the metabolism of the neurodegenerative disease pathogenic proteins alpha-synuclein  beta-amyloid  and tau  including tau phosphorylation  are particularly addressed  with application to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Limitations of the current data are detailed and predictive criteria for translational clinical neuroprotection are proposed and discussed.

"19","19251245","Co-treatment with diazepam prevents the effects of fluoxetine on the proliferation and survival of hippocampal dentate granule cells.","BACKGROUND: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) often produce increased anxiety during the first weeks of treatment before the clinical antidepressant response  and these symptoms are commonly treated with benzodiazepines. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increase proliferation of neuronal progenitors in rodent hippocampus after a delay of approximately 2 weeks.METHODS: We have used this delayed increase in neurogenesis  as detected with both a rapid dot-blot method and with immunostaining  as a model of the delayed clinical antidepressant effects.RESULTS: Whereas the SSRI fluoxetine alone significantly increased both neurogenesis and survival of newborn cells when administered for 2-3 weeks  co-treatment with diazepam and fluoxetine completely blocked the increase in both neurogenesis and survival. Furthermore  neurogenesis was not increased when fluoxetine and diazepam were first co-administered for 2 weeks and then fluoxetine was given alone for 2 additional weeks. Moreover  we show that daily administration is necessary for neurogenesis  because injection of fluoxetine for up to 1 week failed to increase neurogenesis  when assayed at 14 days from the first injection.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that benzodiazepines might interfere with the clinical effects of fluoxetine or that increased neurogenesis is not a valid model for the delayed onset of the clinical antidepressant effects."
"20","18548231","Subnanomolar dopamine D3 receptor antagonism coupled to moderate D2 affinity results in favourable antipsychotic-like activity in rodent models: II. behavioural characterisation of RG-15.","RG-15 (trans-N-[4-[2-[4-(3-cyano-5-trifluoromethyl -phenyl) -piperazine -1 -yl] -ethyl] -cyclohexyl] -3 -pyridinesulfonic amide dihydro-chloride)  is a highly selective dopamine D3/D2 receptor antagonist with subnanomolar affinity for the D3 receptor and nanomolar affinity for the D2 receptor. We found that RG-15 showed a good oral bioavailability (54%) and high brain levels (approx. 900 ng/g) in rats and demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy in amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and conditioned avoidance response tests in rats  yielding ED50 (median effective dose) values of 8.6 and 12 mg/kg orally  respectively. At six- to eightfold higher doses  RG-15 blocked spontaneous motor activity  while a 30 mg/kg dose of the compound caused an increase in the home-cage motility of rats. The drug did not produce catalepsy up to 160 mg/kg oral dose; moreover  it inhibited haloperidol-induced catalepsy in the range 15-60 mg/kg. RG-15 (10 mg/kg orally) restored the impaired learning performance of scopolamine- or diazepam-treated rats in a water-labyrinth paradigm. It is assumed that the motor activating  anticataleptic and cognitive-enhancing properties of RG-15 result from its potent D3 antagonism. In this regard  RG 15 clearly differs from other antipsychotics. Olanzapine  clozapine and amisulpride all showed efficacy against amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and on conditioned avoidance  but compared to RG-15  they proved to be more cataleptogenic and depressed or did not change the home-cage activity of animals. Olanzapine was also inactive in the learning paradigm. Our results suggest that subnanomolar dopamine D3 receptor antagonism coupled to moderate D2 affinity may result in an antipsychotic profile characterised by a lack of extrapyramidal side effects and secondary negative symptoms with simultaneous efficacy on positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia."
"21","18420937","The antidepressant fluoxetine restores plasticity in the adult visual cortex.","We investigated whether fluoxetine  a widely prescribed medication for treatment of depression  restores neuronal plasticity in the adult visual system of the rat. We found that chronic administration of fluoxetine reinstates ocular dominance plasticity in adulthood and promotes the recovery of visual functions in adult amblyopic animals  as tested electrophysiologically and behaviorally. These effects were accompanied by reduced intracortical inhibition and increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the visual cortex. Cortical administration of diazepam prevented the effects induced by fluoxetine  indicating that the reduction of intracortical inhibition promotes visual cortical plasticity in the adult. Our results suggest a potential clinical application for fluoxetine in amblyopia as well as new mechanisms for the therapeutic effects of antidepressants and for the pathophysiology of mood disorders."
"22","17848146","Comparison of trazodone, diazepame and dibenzepine influences on rat brain beta-endorphins content.","The aim of our study was to establish the extent of influence of different psychotropic drugs to brain Beta-endorphins in experimental animals. The study was performed on albino Wistar rats (weight 250 g)  treated with different psychoactive drugs. RIA technique was employed for quantification of brain beta-endorphins. Brain beta-endorphins were higher in experiment group treated with trazodone (929 pg/g +/- 44 43; X+/-SD)  and dibenzepine (906 63 pg/g +/- 74 06)  yet with lower brain content in rats treated with diazepam (841 55 pg/g +/- 68 47)  compared to brain beta-endorphins content of control group treated with saline solution (0 95% NaCl) (873 5 pg/g +/- 44 89). Significant differences were obtained comparing brain beta-endorphins of trazodone vs. diazepam treated animals  with diazepam group having lower values (p&lt;0 02). This study showed differences in changes of rat brain beta-endorphins contents when different psychoactive drugs are used. Therefore  we consider that beta-endorphins could be used for evaluation of effects of psychoactive drugs  as a useful parameter in therapy with these psycho-pharmaceuticals."
"23","16307296","Effect of noradrenergic system on the anxiolytic-like effect of DOI (5-HT2A/2C agonists) in the four-plate test.","RATIONALE: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors demonstrated an anxiolytic-like effect in the four-plate test (FPT). (+/-)-1-(2 5-Dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI; a 5-HT2A receptor agonist) also possessed strong anxiolytic-like effect in the same test. A 5-HT2A mechanism seems to be implicated in the mechanism of action of both antidepressants and DOI in this test. On the other hand  the alpha-adrenergic ligands have also demonstrated an activity in other models of anxiety. A previous study demonstrated that the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists abolished the anxiolytic-like effect of antidepressants.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of noradrenergic system on the regulation of 5-HT2 receptors implicated in the DOI anxiolytic-like activity in the FPT.METHODS: First  the effect of noradrenergic and serotonergic lesions on DOI anxiolytic-like activity was studied in the FPT. Second  the effect of co-administration of alpha-adrenoceptor ligands and DOI was evaluated in the same test.RESULTS: The noradrenergic and serotonergic lesions had no effect on DOI (1 mg/kg) anti-punishment activity in the FPT. Adrafinil 0.25 and 4 mg/kg (an alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist)  prazosin 0.5 and 2 mg/kg (an alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist) and idazoxan 1 and 4 mg/kg (an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist) did not modify the activity of DOI. Clonidine 0.06 mg/kg  guanabenz 0.125 and 0.5 mg/kg (two alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists) and guanfacine 0.06 and 0.125 mg/kg (a specific alpha2A-adrenoceptor agonist) completely abolished DOI-induced increase in punished passages.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the DOI seems to act on the 5-HT2 receptors post-synaptically located. The effect of DOI is regulated by the alpha2-adrenoceptors."
"24","15100702","Role of neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone in antipsychotic-like action of olanzapine in rodents.","Olanzapine increases brain allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels sufficiently to modulate neuronal activity by allosterically regulating GABAA receptors. Recently  we reported the antipsychotic-like profile of ALLO in rodents. The present study examined the hypothesis that olanzapine-induced elevation of endogenous neurosteroid ALLO is vital for its neuroleptic-like action. The conditioned avoidance response (CAR) and apomorphine-induced climbing behavioral paradigms were used in rodents. Administration of ALLO (1 microg  intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)) or neurosteroidogenic agents such as the mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor receptor agonist  FGIN 1-27 (0.5 microg  i.c.v.) or the ALLO precursor  progesterone (10 mg/kg  i.p.) significantly potentiated olanzapine-induced blockade of CAR and apomorphine-induced climbing. In contrast  these agents failed to alter the antipsychotic-like effect of risperidone and haloperidol. On the other hand  inhibition of the endogenous biosynthesis of neurosteroids by the 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor  trilostane (30 mg/kg  i.p.)  the 3alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase inhibitor  indomethacin (5 mg/kg  i.p.)  or the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (1 mg/kg  i.p.) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (1 mg/kg  i.p.) blocked the effect of olanzapine  but not of risperidone and haloperidol. Socially isolated animals  known to exhibit decreased brain ALLO and GABAA receptor functions  displayed a shortening in the muscimol-induced loss of righting reflex and an increased susceptibility to apomorphine-induced climbing. Administration of olanzapine  but not of haloperidol and risperidone  normalized the duration of muscimol-elicited loss of righting reflex. Although all three antipsychotics proved capable of antagonizing the apomorphine-induced climbing  a dose almost five times higher of olanzapine was required in socially isolated animals. The data obtained suggest that enhancement of the GABAergic tone plays a key role in the antipsychotic-like effect exerted by olanzapine in rodents  likely as a consequence of augmented levels of neuroactive steroids  in particular ALLO  in the brain. The present findings provide the first specific behavioral evidence in support of the hypothesis that neuroactive steroid ALLO- mediated GABAergic modulation is essential for the antipsychotic-like action of olanzapine."
"25","14531941","Cytoprotective effect is one of common action pathways for antidepressants.","AIM: To explore the possible common action mechanism of antidepressants.METHODS: The cell viability was detected by MTT assay. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by Fura 2-AM fluorescence labeling assay. Using RT-PCR  the mRNA level of nerve growth factor (NGF) was also detected.RESULTS: High concentration of corticosterone (0.2 mmol/L) was incubated with PC12 cells to simulate the lesion state of brain neurons in depressive illness. Three main kinds of antidepressants used in clinic [(1) tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  such as desipramine (DIM) 0.625-10 micromol/L; (2) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  such as fluoxetine (FLU) 0.625-10 micromol/L; (3) monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)  such as moclobemide (MOC) 2.5-40 micromol/L] protected cells from the lesion induced by corticosterone. While antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine or anxiolytic agent diazepam 0.4-50 micromol/L had no such effect. Moreover  DIM 1  5 micromol/L or FLU 1  5 micromol/L attenuated the [Ca2+]i overload induced by corticosterone 0.1 mmol/L for 48 h in PC12 cells. Furthermore  treatment with DIM or FLU 10 micromol/L for 48 h elevated the NGF mRNA expression in PC12 cells.CONCLUSION: Despite a remarkable structural diversity  the cytoprotective effect can be viewed as the common action pathway of the antidepressants. Moreover  attenuation of the intracellular Ca2+ overload and elevation of neurotrophic factor (such as NGF) expression is one of the mechanisms of cytoprotective effect of antidepressants."
"26","12600706","Stress-induced vocalisation in adult animals. A valid model of anxiety?","The post-stimuli anticipatory vocalisations that follow stressful and painful conditions are suggested as a quantitative measure of the emotional state of fear and anxiety in animal models. Adult rats emit characteristic 22-kHz ultrasound vocalisations consisting of 20-30 kHz calls with a mean duration of 300-600 ms as response to aversive stimuli (e.g. inescapable electric footshock  acoustic or air-puff stimuli  agonistic encounter or withdrawal from treatment with drugs of abuse). The vocalisations are accompanied by defensive submissive behaviour and signal a refractory  socially withdrawn or helpless state. Furthermore  brain structures that are involved in the mediation of anxiety-like behaviour  e.g. the dorsal periaqueductal grey and cortical areas  are also important for modulation of ultrasonic vocalisation. Benzodiazepines  e.g. diazepam  inhibit shock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation although the active doses are generally close to those that produce sedation and muscle relaxation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants that preferentially enhance serotonergic neurotransmission inhibit footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation. The 5-HT(2) receptor antagonistic properties of fluoxetine may explain why only partial inhibition is achieved. The biphasic dose-response curve of the racemic drug  citalopram  may perhaps be ascribed to an attenuating effect of R-citalopram. Tricyclic antidepressants  e.g. imipramine  and antidepressants that preferentially enhance catecholaminergic neurotransmission  e.g. reboxetine and venlafaxine  are inactive. Classical antipsychotics like haloperidol have no or a weak inhibitory effect. Serotonin plays a major role in the mediation of ultrasonic vocalisation  and in particular 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2) receptors are found to have a prominent role. Different serotonergic pathways are likely to be involved in the mediation of the anxiolytic-like response  e.g. the pathway ascending from the dorsal raphe nucleus through the medial forebrain bundle to the amygdala and frontal cortex mediating conditioned/learned anxiety and another pathway ascending from the dorsal raphe nucleus to the periaqueductal grey mediating unconditioned/fight flight anxiety. Dopamine D(2) receptor agonists are potent inhibitors of footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation. The role of dopamine D(1) receptors and adrenoceptors remains to be further elucidated. Several other neurotransmitters are involved in the mediation of ultrasonic vocalisation  e.g. acetylcholine  histamine and glutamate. There is also a need for further studies of how changes in stress-axis function may modulate ultrasonic vocalisation and for studies of the effects of chronic drug treatment on ultrasonic vocalisation."
"27","12435798","Expression profile and up-regulation of PRAX-1 mRNA by antidepressant treatment in the rat brain.","A protein associated with the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PRAX-1) has recently been cloned  but its regional distribution in the central nervous system and its function remain to be clarified. In situ hybridization was carried out to localize PRAX-1 mRNA in the rat brain and revealed a high expression of the transcript in limbic structures such as the CA1 region of the hippocampus  as well as the dentate gyrus  septum  amygdala  and the islands of Calleja. A dense hybridization signal was also observed in the nucleus accumbens  caudate nucleus  olfactory tubercle  pineal gland  and cerebellar cortex. PRAX-1 mRNA expression was largely neuronal; it colocalized with neuron-specific enolase but not glial fibrillary acidic protein. Long-term treatments (21 days) with the neuroleptic haloperidol increased PRAX-1 mRNA expression only in the dentate gyrus  whereas anxiolytic/anticonvulsant diazepam had no effect in any of the hippocampal region studied. Repeated electroconvulsive shock administration significantly enhanced PRAX1 expression in the CA1 subfield and dentate gyrus. Several classes of antidepressant treatment  including serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine)  mixed serotonin- and norepinephrine-uptake inhibitor (imipramine)  and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (iproniazid and tranylcypromine)  shared this effect. Furthermore  the selective nonpeptide NK2 receptor antagonist (S)-N-methyl-N-[4-acetylamino-4-phenylpiperidino)-2-(3 4-dichlorophenyl)butyl]benzamide (SR48968)  which shows an antidepressant profile in animal studies  also enhanced PRAX-1 mRNA expression. These results point to a potential role of PRAX-1 function in the central nervous system and suggest that the up-regulation of PRAX-1 mRNA represents a common action of chronic antidepressant treatment."

Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis  we investigated the effects of short- and long-term oral treatments with several psychotropics on type II nitric oxide synthase gene expression in the rat brain. With maprotiline and fluvoxamine  enzyme mRNA levels were higher after a 28 day treatment than after 1 and 4 day treatments. Zonisamide  carbamazepine and diazepam also increased mRNA  though differences in levels between 1  4 and 28 day treatments were not significant. These results suggest that psychotropics modulate the gene expression of type-II nitric oxide synthase in the brain."
"29","12082565","Marked suppression of gastric ulcerogenesis and intestinal responses to stress by a novel class of drugs.","When exposed to prolonged stress  rats develop gastric ulceration  enhanced colon motility with depletion of its mucin content and signs of physiological and behavioral arousal. In this model  we tested whether antidepressants (fluoxetine and bupropion)  anxiolytics (diazepam and buspirone) or the novel nonpeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) type-1 receptor (CRH-R1) antagonist  antalarmin  modify these responses. Fluoxetine  bupropion  diazepam and antalarmin all suppressed stress-induced gastric ulceration in male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to four hours of plain immobilization. Antalarmin produced the most pronounced anti-ulcer effect and additionally suppressed the stress-induced colonic hypermotility  mucin depletion  autonomic hyperarousal and struggling behavior. Intraperitoneal CRH administration reproduced the intestinal but not the gastric responses to stress while vagotomy antagonized the stress-induced gastric ulceration but not the intestinal responses. We conclude that brain CRH-R1 and vagal pathways are essential for gastric ulceration to occur in response to stress and that peripheral CRH-R1 mediates colonic hypermotility and mucin depletion in this model. Nonpeptide CRH-R1 antagonists may therefore be prophylactic against stress ulcer in the critically ill and therapeutic for other pathogenetically related gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer disease and irritable bowel syndrome."
"30","11992474","Extended action of MKC-242, a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, on light-induced Per gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in mice.","We reported previously that (S)-5-[3-[(1 4-benzodioxan-2-ylmethyl)amino]propoxy]-1 3-benzodioxole hydrochloride (MKC-242) (3 mg kg(-1)  i.p.)  a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist  accelerated the re-entrainment of hamster wheel-running rhythms to a new 8 hr delayed or advanced light-dark cycle  and also potentiated the phase advance of the wheel-running rhythm produced by light pulses. The molecular mechanism underlying MKC-242-induced potentiation of this phase shift  however  has not yet been elucidated. We examined the effects of MKC-242 on light-induced mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of mice. MKC-242 (5 mg kg(-1)  i.p.) potentiated light-induced mPer1 and mPer2 expression in the SCN of mice housed in constant darkness for 2 days  when mRNA levels were observed 3 hr after light-exposure. More potentiating action of MKC-242 on mPer2 expression in the SCN was observed in mice housed in constant darkness for 9-10 days. This facilitatory action of MKC-242 on mPer1 expression was antagonized by WAY100635  a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor blocker  indicating that MKC-242 activated 5-HT(1A) receptors. Other drugs such as 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (10 mg kg(-1)  i.p.)  paroxetine (10 mg kg(-1)  i.p.)  buspirone (10 mg kg(-1)  i.p.)  and diazepam (10 mg kg(-1)  i.p.) did not display a potentiating action on light-induced mPer1 and mPer2 expression in the SCN. In the behavioral experiments  we found that MKC-242 (5 mg kg(-1)  i.p.) potentiated light-induced phase delays of free-running rhythm in mice. The present results suggest that prolonged increase of mPer1 or mPer2 expression in the SCN by MKC-242 may be involved in the potentiation of photic entrainment by MKC-242 in mice."
"31","11522332","Behavioral and neurochemical changes following predatory stress in mice.","This article had several objectives. First it aimed at investigating the anxiogenic-like behaviors elicited by unavoidable cat exposure and/or cat odor across nine strains of mice (BALB/c  C57BL/6  C3H  CBA  DBA/2  NMRI  NZB  SJL  Swiss) in a modified version of the free-exploration test. The second objective was to investigate possible neurochemical changes following cat exposure in Swiss mice by measuring the turnover of dopamine (DA)  noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) in several brain regions known to be involved in the modulation of emotional processes (hippocampus  hypothalamus and striatum). Finally  the third objective was to examine the effects of anxiolytic drug treatments on the anxiogenic responses elicited by a cat odor (i.e. a feces) in Swiss mice previously exposed to a cat using the free-exploration test. Results from the strain comparison showed that mice could be divided into three distinct groups: two non-reactive strains (NZB and SJL) which were relatively insensitive to predatory exposure and/or odor; five intermediate-reactive strains (Swiss  NMRI  CBA  C3H and BALB/c) which displayed clear anxiogenic-like responses only when exposed to both cat and  subsequently  to feces; and two high reactive strains (C57BL/6 and DBA/2) which showed anxiogenic-like reactions following cat exposure  regardless of the stimulus (clay or feces) present in the free-exploration cage. Neurochemical data revealed that  while brain levels of NA  DA  5-HT in cat exposed Swiss mice were not significantly different from those of control animals  turnover rates of these monoamines were increased in the hippocampus (NA and 5-HT)  hypothalamus and striatum (DA) after cat exposure. Results from pharmacological experiments indicated that repeated administration of the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (5-20 mg/kg  twice a day  for 5 days) completely abolished avoidance of the cat feces in Swiss mice previously exposed to the predator. Neither acute nor repeated administration of the classical anxiolytic diazepam was able to reduce avoidance behavior of the anxiogenic stimulus in the free-exploration test. Taken together  these findings indicate that the exposure of mice to unavoidable predatory stimuli is associated with behavioral and neurochemical changes consistent with increased anxiety."
