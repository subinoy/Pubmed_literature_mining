Serotonin (5-HT) and the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) have increasingly been shown to play important roles in both brain and intestinal development and long-term function. 5-HT and SERT may thus modulate critical functions in the development and perpetuation of brain-gut axis disease. We discuss the potential roles of 5-HT and SERT in the brain and intestinal manifestations of autism spectrum disorders and developmental antidepressant exposure. The potential therapeutic value of 5-HT4 modulation in the subsequent treatment of these conditions is also addressed."

We included published  peer-reviewed articles written in English.DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers used standardized instruments for data extraction and quality assessment. We generated pooled estimates for studies of the same design for SSRI exposure at any time during pregnancy and exposure during the first trimester. Subanalyses were conducted among studies with analyses (1) adjusted for MMI and (2) restricted to MMI.RESULTS: We included in the meta-analysis 4 case-control studies and 2 cohort studies. In the case-control studies  the adjusted pooled odds ratio (aPOR) values were 1.4 (95% CI  1.0-2.0) (any) and 1.7 (95% CI  1.1-2.6) (first trimester). In MMI-adjusted analyses  only first trimester exposure remained statistically significant (aPOR = 1.8; 95% CI  1.1-3.1). In MMI-restricted analyses  neither exposure period was statistically significant. In the cohort studies  MMI-adjusted relative risk values were 1.5 (95% CI  0.9-2.7) (any) and 1.4 (95% CI  1.0-1.9) (first trimester). In MMI-restricted analyses  SSRI exposure at any time during pregnancy was nonsignificant.CONCLUSIONS: It remains unclear whether the association between first trimester SSRI exposure and child autism that was present in the case-control studies even after adjustment for MMI is a true association or a product of residual confounding. Future studies require robust measurement of MMI prior to and during pregnancy."

Additionally  to determine the rates of prescribed treatment for obesity-related metabolic disorders and to determine whether treatment with psychotropic medications is associated with the development of obesity for children with ASD.STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective 1:5 case-control study was performed by use of the Military Health System database from October 2000 to September 2013. For children with ASD and matched controls  International Classification of Diseases  Ninth Revision  Clinical Modification diagnostic codes for obesity  type 2 diabetes mellitus  hypertension  hyperlipidemia  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  and prescriptions were obtained. Conditional logistic regression determined ORs and 95% CIs.RESULTS: A total of 48<U+2009>762 individuals with ASD and 243<U+2009>810 matched controls were identified. Children with ASD had significantly greater odds of having obesity (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.78-1.92)  having obesity-related disorders  and being prescribed a medication when they had these diseases. In children with ASD  mood stabilizers  antipsychotics  antiepileptic drugs  and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with obesity.CONCLUSIONS: Children with ASD have an increased risk of obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders. They are more likely to be prescribed medications to treat these complications  suggesting they may have more severe disease. There is a significant association between the use of some psychotropic categories and a diagnosis of obesity  suggesting that obesity in children with ASD may be partially iatrogenic."

Prenatal SSRI exposure has been associated with an increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)  and peripheral 5-HT is elevated in some ASD patients. Perinatal SSRI exposure in rodents has been associated with increased depression and anxiety-like behavior  decreased sociability  and impaired learning in the offspring  behaviors often seen in ASD. The present study investigated whether perinatal exposure to citalopram causes persistent neurobehavioral effects. Gravid Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to two groups and subcutaneously injected twice per day with citalopram (10mg/kg; Cit) or saline (Sal) 6h apart on embryonic day (E)6-21  and then drug was given directly to the pups after delivery from postnatal day (P)1-20. Starting on P60  one male/female from each litter was tested in the Cincinnati water maze (CWM) and open-field before and after MK-801. A second pair from each litter was tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) and open-field before and after (+)-amphetamine. A third pair was tested as follows: elevated zero-maze  open-field  marble burying  prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle  social preference  and forced swim. Cit-exposed rats were impaired in the MWM during acquisition and probe  but not during reversal  shift  or cued trials. Cit-exposed rats also showed increased marble burying  decreased time in the center of the open-field  decreased latency to immobility in forced swim  and increased acoustic startle across prepulse intensities with no effects on CWM. The results are consistent with citalopram inducing several ASD-like effects. The findings add to concerns about use of SSRIs during pregnancy. Further research on different classes of antidepressants  dose-effect relationships  timing of exposure periods  and mechanisms for these effects are needed. It is also important to balance the effects described here against the effects of the disorders for which the drugs are given."

"11","27138915","Safety of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors in Pregnancy: A Review of Current Evidence.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed antidepressant medications worldwide. However  over the past decade  their use during pregnancy  a period of extreme vulnerability to the onset of depression  has become highly concerning to patients and their healthcare providers in terms of safety to the developing fetus. Exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy has been associated with miscarriage  premature delivery  neonatal complications  birth defects-specifically cardiac defects-and  more recently  neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood  specifically autism spectrum disorders. Studies addressing the effect of individual SSRIs indicate a small but higher risk for birth defects with maternal fluoxetine and paroxetine use. Though the excess in absolute risk is small  it may still be of concern to some patients. Meanwhile  antenatal depression itself is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes  and discontinuing antidepressant treatment during pregnancy is associated with a high risk of relapse of depression. Whether the observed adverse fetal effects are related to the mother's medication use or her underlying maternal illness remains difficult to determine. It is important that every pregnant woman being treated with an SSRI (or considering such treatment) carefully weighs the risks of treatment against the risk of untreated depression for both herself and her child. The importance of recognizing a higher risk for the development of adverse outcomes lies in the potential for surveillance and possibly a timely intervention. Therefore  we recommend that pregnant women exposed to any SSRI in early pregnancy be offered options for prenatal diagnosis through ultrasound examinations and fetal echocardiography to detect the presence of birth defects. Tapering off or switching to other therapy in early pregnancy  if appropriate for the individual  may also be considered on a case-by-case basis."

Pregnant women and their offspring were categorized into 4 groups: SSRI exposed (n = 15 729); exposed to psychiatric disorder  no antidepressants (n = 9 651); exposed to SSRIs only before pregnancy (n = 7 980); and unexposed to antidepressants and psychiatric disorders (n = 31 394). We investigated the cumulative incidence of offspring diagnoses of depression  anxiety  autism spectrum disorder (ASD)  and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for the 4 groups from birth to 14 years  adjusting for confounders.RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of depression among offspring exposed prenatally to SSRIs was 8.2% (95% CI = 3.1-13.3%) by age 14.9 years  compared with 1.9% (95% CI = 0.9-2.9%) in the psychiatric disorder  no medication group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.78; 95% CI = 1.12-2.82; p = .02) and to 2.8% (95% CI = 1.4-4.3%) in the SSRI discontinued group (HR = 1.84; 95% CI = 1.14-2.97; p = .01). Rates of anxiety  ASD  and ADHD diagnoses were comparable to rates in offspring of mothers with a psychiatric disorder but no medication during pregnancy. Comparing SSRI exposed to unexposed individuals  the HRs were significantly elevated for each outcome.CONCLUSION: Prenatal SSRI exposure was associated with increased rates of depression diagnoses in early adolescence but not with ASD or ADHD. Until confirmed  these findings must be balanced against the substantial adverse consequences of untreated maternal depression."
"13","27064142","Challenges and Promises of Pediatric Psychopharmacology.","Most prescriptions for psychotropic medications are written by primary care physicians  yet pediatricians  many of whom are teaching residents and medical students about pediatric psychopharmacology  often feel inadequately trained to treat mental health concerns. Over the past several decades  the number  size  and quality of psychopharmacologic studies in youth has greatly increased. Here we review the current evidence for efficacy and safety of each of the major pharmacologic drug classes in youth (psychostimulants  antidepressants  mood stabilizers  and antipsychotics). Psychostimulants have a robust body of literature supporting their evidence as first-line treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have documented efficacy for pediatric depression and multiple different anxiety disorders with childhood onset. Combining cognitive-behavioral therapy with SSRI treatment enhances treatment benefit and minimizes adverse events of medication. Mood stabilizers  including lithium and anticonvulsant medications  have a less robust strength of evidence and come with more problematic side effects. However  they are increasingly prescribed to youth  often to treat irritability  mood lability  and aggression  along with treatment of bipolar disorder. Antipsychotics have long been a mainstay of treatment for childhood-onset schizophrenia  and in recent years  the evidence base for providing antipsychotics to youth with bipolar mania and autistic disorder has grown. Most concerning with antipsychotics are the metabolic side effects  which appear even more problematic in youth than adults. By better understanding the evidence-based psychopharmacologic interventions  academic pediatricians will be able to treat patients and prepare future pediatrician to address the growing mental health care needs of youth."

Data analyses were performed in July 2015  and additional analyses were added in November 2015.STUDY SELECTION: Longitudinal studies reporting on T2DM incidence in youth 2 to 24 years old exposed to antipsychotics for at least 3 months.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent investigators extracted study-level data for a random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression of T2DM risk.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The coprimary outcomes were study-defined T2DM  expressed as cumulative T2DM risk or as T2DM incidence rate per patient-years. Secondary outcomes included the comparison of the coprimary outcomes in antipsychotic-treated youth with psychiatric controls not receiving antipsychotics or with healthy controls.RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in the meta-analysis  including 185 105 youth exposed to antipsychotics and 310 438 patient-years. The mean (SD) age of patients was 14.1 (2.1) years  and 59.5% were male. The mean (SD) follow-up was 1.7 (2.3) years. Among them  7 studies included psychiatric controls (1 342 121 patients and 2 071 135 patient-years)  and 8 studies included healthy controls (298 803 patients and 463 084 patient-years). Antipsychotic-exposed youth had a cumulative T2DM risk of 5.72 (95% CI  3.45-9.48; P &lt;<U+2009>.001) per 1000 patients. The incidence rate was 3.09 (95% CI  2.35-3.82; P &lt;<U+2009>.001) cases per 1000 patient-years. Compared with healthy controls  cumulative T2DM risk (odds ratio [OR]  2.58; 95% CI  1.56-4.24; P &lt;<U+2009>.0001) and incidence rate ratio (IRR) (IRR  3.02; 95% CI  1.71-5.35; P &lt;<U+2009>.0001) were significantly greater in antipsychotic-exposed youth. Similarly  compared with psychiatric controls  antipsychotic-exposed youth had significantly higher cumulative T2DM risk (OR  2.09; 95% CI  1.50-52.90; P &lt;<U+2009>.0001) and IRR (IRR  1.79; 95% CI  1.31-2.44; P &lt;<U+2009>.0001). In multivariable meta-regression analyses of 10 studies  greater cumulative T2DM risk was associated with longer follow-up (P &lt;<U+2009>.001)  olanzapine prescription (P &lt;<U+2009>.001)  and male sex (P =<U+2009>.002) (r(2)<U+2009>= 1.00  P &lt;<U+2009>.001). Greater T2DM incidence was associated with second-generation antipsychotic prescription (P = .050) and less autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (P =<U+2009>.048) (r(2)<U+2009>= 0.21  P =<U+2009>.044).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although T2DM seems rare in antipsychotic-exposed youth  cumulative risk and exposure-adjusted incidences and IRRs were significantly higher than in healthy controls and psychiatric controls. Olanzapine treatment and antipsychotic exposure time were the main modifiable risk factors for T2DM development in antipsychotic-exposed youth. Antipsychotics should be used judiciously and for the shortest necessary duration  and their efficacy and safety should be monitored proactively."
"18","26782158","Annual Research Review: The role of the environment in the developmental psychopathology of autism spectrum condition.","BACKGROUND: Although autism spectrum condition (ASC) is strongly genetic in origin  accumulating evidence points to the critical roles of various environmental influences on its emergence and subsequent developmental course.METHODS: A developmental psychopathology framework was used to synthesise literature on environmental factors associated with the onset and course of ASC (based on a systematic search of the literature using PubMed  PsychInfo and Google Scholar databases). Particular emphasis was placed on gene-environment interplay  including gene-environment interaction (G × E) and gene-environment correlation (rGE).RESULTS: Before conception  advanced paternal and maternal ages may independently enhance offspring risk for ASC. Exogenous prenatal risks are evident (e.g. valproate and toxic chemicals) or possible (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)  and processes endogenous to the materno-foeto-placental unit (e.g. maternal diabetes  enhanced steroidogenic activities and maternal immune activation) likely heighten offspring vulnerability to ASC. Folate intake is a prenatal protective factor  with a particular window of action around 4 weeks preconception and during the first trimester. These prenatal risks and protective mechanisms appear to involve G × E and potentially rGE. A variety of perinatal risks are related to offspring ASC risk  possibly reflecting rGE. Postnatal social factors (e.g. caregiver-infant interaction  severe early deprivation) during the first years of life may operate through rGE to influence the likelihood of manifesting a full ASC phenotype from a 'prodromal' phase (a proposal distinct to the discredited and harmful 'refrigerator mother hypothesis'); and later postnatal risks  after the full manifestation of ASC  shape life span development through transactions mediated by rGE. There is no evidence that vaccination is a postnatal risk for ASC.CONCLUSIONS: Future investigations should consider the specificity of risks for ASC versus other atypical neurodevelopmental trajectories  timing of risk and protective mechanisms  animal model systems to study mechanisms underlying gene-environment interplay  large-sample genome-envirome designs to address G × E and longitudinal studies to elucidate how rGE plays out over time.

The etiology of ASD remains unclear  although studies have implicated genetic predispositions  environmental risk factors  and maternal depression.OBJECTIVE: To examine the risk of ASD in children associated with antidepressant use during pregnancy according to trimester of exposure and taking into account maternal depression.DESIGN  SETTING  AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a register-based study of an ongoing population-based cohort  the Québec Pregnancy/Children Cohort  which includes data on all pregnancies and children in Québec from January 1  1998  to December 31  2009. A total of 145 456 singleton full-term infants born alive and whose mothers were covered by the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec drug plan for at least 12 months before and during pregnancy were included. Data analysis was conducted from October 1  2014  to June 30  2015.EXPOSURES: Antidepressant exposure during pregnancy was defined according to trimester and specific antidepressant classes.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Children with ASD were defined as those with at least 1 diagnosis of ASD between date of birth and last date of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate crude and adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs.RESULTS: During 904 035.50 person-years of follow-up  1054 children (0.7%) were diagnosed with ASD; boys with ASD outnumbered girls by a ratio of about 4:1. The mean (SD) age of children at the end of follow-up was 6.24 (3.19) years. Adjusting for potential confounders  use of antidepressants during the second and/or third trimester was associated with the risk of ASD (31 exposed infants; adjusted hazard ratio  1.87; 95% CI  1.15-3.04). Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during the second and/or third trimester was significantly associated with an increased risk of ASD (22 exposed infants; adjusted hazard ratio  2.17; 95% CI  1.20-3.93). The risk was persistent even after taking into account maternal history of depression (29 exposed infants; adjusted hazard ratio  1.75; 95% CI  1.03-2.97).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of antidepressants  specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  during the second and/or third trimester increases the risk of ASD in children  even after considering maternal depression. Further research is needed to specifically assess the risk of ASD associated with antidepressant types and dosages during pregnancy."

CYP2C19 encodes the primary enzyme responsible for escitalopram metabolism and we investigated whether polymorphisms in CYP2C19 were related to symptoms and dosing in a pharmacogenetic study of ASD.PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Participants completed the Aberrant Behavior Checklist--Community Version (ABC-CV) weekly for 6 weeks. Escitalopram was initiated at a dose of 2.5 mg per day  with weekly increases to 20 mg unless intolerable side-effects occurred. Three CYP2C19 metabolizer groups  including ultrarapid  extensive  and reduced metabolizers  were examined in relation to symptom improvement and tolerated dose.RESULTS: ABC-CV scores improved over the course of treatment (P&lt;0.0001). No differences were identified in the rate of improvement across metabolizer groups for the ABC-CV irritability subscale  which was the primary outcome for clinical symptoms. There was a trend for a metabolizer group by time interaction with respect to dose (P=0.10). This interaction was driven by the linear rate of change from week 1 to study endpoint between the reduced metabolizers and ultrarapid metabolizer groups (P=0.05). Post-hoc analyses identified significant differences in the rate of dose escalation between ultrarapid metabolizers and extensive metabolizers and for ultrarapid metabolizers compared with reduced metabolizers (P's&lt;0.04)  whereby ultrarapid metabolizers showed a slower rate of change in dose over time.CONCLUSION: CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers were associated with reduced tolerance to a fixed titration schedule of open-label escitalopram in this ASD study sample. Possible explanations may involve the altered kinetics of faster metabolizers or previously unknown activities of escitalopram metabolites."

"26","26221830","Affective communication in rodents: serotonin and its modulating role in ultrasonic vocalizations.","Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine  5-HT) is an important modulatory neurotransmitter and functions as a key neurodevelopmental signal in the mammalian brain. 5-HT plays a prominent role in regulating various types of psychological processes and functions  including mood and emotion  particularly anxiety  but also in regulating social behavior. Consequently  the 5-HT system is implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders  such as anxiety disorders and depression or autism spectrum disorders (ASD)  with selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors being the frontline medication. Mice and rats perceive and emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USV). It is widely believed that the various distinct USV types reflect the animal's affective state  such as anxiety or pleasure. Furthermore  they serve communicative functions  for instance  as alarm calls or social contact calls. Manipulations targeting the 5-HT system alter affective ultrasonic communication in rodents throughout life  probably because of its important role in regulating anxiety and social behavior. Ample evidence indicates the involvement of the 5-HT system in modulating isolation-induced USV in pups. Later in life  the 5-HT system plays a strong modulatory role in the emission of aversive 22-kHz USV in rats. So far  little is known about the role of 5-HT in the production of interaction-induced USV in mice and appetitive 50-kHz USV in rats  although recent findings also suggest a modulatory effect of the 5-HT system. Assessment of rodent USV is a valuable method to investigate mood and emotion  and to enhance our understanding of  and develop novel pharmacological therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders  such as anxiety disorders and depression or ASD."

He became bedridden  accompanied by sleep disturbance  sustained upward gaze  and generalized rigidity. Magnetic resonance imaging showed unremarkable findings  but antiglutamate receptor autoantibodies were positive in his cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment with thiamine infusion and steroid pulse therapy showed little effect  but gross motor dysfunction and appetite loss were ameliorated by the administration of l-DOPA and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Thereafter  autistic behaviors predominated  including loss of social interaction  oral tendency  water phobia  and aggressiveness. Initiation of donepezil  an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor  resulted in the disappearance of these symptoms and total recovery of the patient to his previous psychosocial levels. We hypothesize that the acute regression in adolescence represents a process closely related to the defects of serotonergic and cholinergic systems that are innate to DS brains and not just a nonspecific comorbidity of depression or limbic encephalitis."

The aim of this study was to explore the association of A2BP1 gene polymorphisms with antipsychotic induced weight gain (AIWG) in Chinese Han population. Three hundred and twenty-eight patients with schizophrenia were followed-up for an 8-week period of treatment with olanzapine. The fasting weights of 328 patients were measured before and after the 8-week course of treatment. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs8048076  rs1478697  rs10500331  and rs4786847) of the A2BP1 gene were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We analyzed putative association of A2BP1 polymorphisms with AIWG of olanzapine using linear regression analysis and found that SNP rs1478697 was significantly associated with AIWG caused by olanzapine (p=0.0012; Bonferroni corrected p=0.0048). The association was replicated in another independent sample including 208 first-episode and drug-naïve patients presenting with schizophrenia after a 4-week treatment with olanzapine (p=0.0092; Bonferroni corrected p=0.0368; meta p=5.33×10(-5)). To explore the biological plausibility of A2BP1 in the pathogenesis of AIWG  we made expression analyses and eQTL analyses; these analyses showed that A2BP1 was highly expressed in whole brain tissues using the HBT database  and that rs1478697 has an expression quantitative trait locus effect in human cerebellar cortex tissues using the BRAINEAC database (p=2.50E-04). In conclusion  the rs1478697 in A2BP1 may be associated with AIWG induced by 8-week treatment with olanzapine."

In experimental animals  early life exposure to serotonergic antidepressants or maternal stress affects brain development  with subsequent changes in serotonin tone in adult animals. Recently  antidepressant exposure during pregnancy has been associated with autism in epidemiological studies. At least part of the association is potentially explained by maternal depression or factors associated with depression. Importantly  even if there is no causal relation between prenatal antidepressant exposure and autism  use of antidepressants during pregnancy is a marker of potential problems later in life across five independent study populations  and exposed children may need special attention regardless of the underlying mechanism. Future studies need to disentangle the effects of maternal depression and antidepressant use during pregnancy while adjusting for the postnatal environment. One promising strategy is to use results from basic science to guide the inclusion of potential biological intermediates in advanced epidemiological studies."

Major depressive disorder (MDD) was identified using a structured clinical interview (SCID-I/NP). The cross-sectional associations between BMD and both MDD and antidepressant use were analyzed using multivariable linear regression.RESULTS: Of the study population  84 (9.1%) men had a single MDD episode  50 (5.4%) had recurrent episodes and 65 (7.0%) were using antidepressants at the time of assessment. Following adjustments  recurrent MDD was associated with lower BMD at the forearm and total body (-6.5%  P=0.033 and -2.5%  P=0.033  respectively compared to men with no history of MDD)  while single MDD episodes were associated with higher BMD at the total hip (+3.4%  P=0.030). Antidepressant use was associated with lower BMD only in lower-weight men (&lt;75-110 kg depending on bone site).CONCLUSIONS: Both depression and use of antidepressants should be taken into account as possible risk factors for osteoporosis in men."

"32","26022075","Putative Microcircuit-Level Substrates for Attention Are Disrupted in Mouse Models of Autism.","BACKGROUND: Deep layer excitatory circuits in the prefrontal cortex represent the strongest locus for genetic convergence in autism  but specific abnormalities within these circuits that mediate key features of autism  such as cognitive or attentional deficits  remain unknown. Attention normally increases the sensitivity of neural populations to incoming signals by decorrelating ongoing cortical circuit activity. Here  we investigated whether mechanisms underlying this phenomenon might be disrupted within deep layer prefrontal circuits in mouse models of autism.METHODS: We isolated deep layer prefrontal circuits in brain slices then used single-photon GCaMP imaging to record activity from many (50 to 100) neurons simultaneously to study patterns of spontaneous activity generated by these circuits under normal conditions and in two etiologically distinct models of autism: mice exposed to valproic acid in utero and Fmr1 knockout mice.RESULTS: We found that modest doses of the cholinergic agonist carbachol normally decorrelate spontaneous activity generated by deep layer prefrontal networks. This effect was disrupted in both valproic acid-exposed and Fmr1 knockout mice but intact following other manipulations that did not model autism.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cholinergic modulation may contribute to attention by acting on local cortical microcircuits to decorrelate spontaneous activity. Furthermore  defects in this mechanism represent a microcircuit-level endophenotype that could link diverse genetic and developmental disruptions to attentional deficits in autism. Future studies could elucidate pathways leading from various etiologies to this circuit-level abnormality or use this abnormality itself as a target and identify novel therapeutic strategies that restore normal circuit function."

Apart from being a neurotransmitter  serotonin functions as a neurotrophic factor directing brain development and as an immunoregulator modulating immune responses. Serotonin transporter (SERT) regulates serotonin level in lymphoid tissues to ensure its proper functioning in innate and adaptive responses. Immunological molecules such as cytokines in turn regulate the transcription and activity of SERT. Dysregulation of serotonergic system could trigger signalling cascades that affect normal neural-immune interactions culminating in neurodevelopmental and neural connectivity defects precipitating behavioural abnormalities  or the disease phenotypes. Therefore  we suggest that a better understanding of the cross talk between serotonergic genes  immune systems and serotonergic neurotransmission will open wider avenues to develop pharmacological leads for addressing the core ASD behavioural deficits."

Careful with that axe, Eugene.","Until 2005  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  the class of antidepressants most frequently used in clinical practice  had been deemed devoid of any teratogenic effects. However  in recent years several concerns have been raised about their reproductive safety  including: disturbed fetal development  increased rates of congenital anomalies  increased risks of neonatal complications  neuro-motor delay and even autism. Specific concerns are also arising about the safety of SSRIs for infants breastfed by mothers who take such medications in puerperium. Such considerations have led to the 'bad reproductive reputation' of SSRIs  whose utilization during pregnancy and breastfeeding is deemed incautious. Specific reproductive problems also involve tricyclic antidepressants  especially clomipramine. Thus  any conclusion about what antidepressant should be considered the safest during pregnancy must be stated and read with great caution. However  the risks associated with pharmacological treatment must be balanced with the effects of untreated antenatal maternal depression on the mother-fetus dyad  which are likely to be devastating. During puerperium  it is mandatory to weigh the risks to the infant of antidepressant exposure through breast milk against the disadvantage of not receiving mother's milk and being exposed to a relapse of maternal mood symptoms (which may also have tragic consequences for the patient)."

We have previously shown that loss of GluD1 leads to social and cognitive deficits in mice  however  its role in synaptic development and neurotransmission remains poorly understood. Here we report that GluD1 is enriched in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and GluD1 knockout mice exhibit a higher dendritic spine number  greater excitatory neurotransmission as well as higher number of synapses in mPFC. In addition abnormalities in the LIMK1-cofilin signaling  which regulates spine dynamics  and a lower ratio of GluN2A/GluN2B expression was observed in the mPFC in GluD1 knockout mice. Analysis of the GluD1 knockout CA1 hippocampus similarly indicated the presence of higher spine number and synapses and altered LIMK1-cofilin signaling. We found that systemic administration of an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor partial agonist d-cycloserine (DCS) at a high-dose  but not at a low-dose  and a GluN2B-selective inhibitor Ro-25-6981 partially normalized the abnormalities in LIMK1-cofilin signaling and reduced excess spine number in mPFC and hippocampus. The molecular effects of high-dose DCS and GluN2B inhibitor correlated with their ability to reduce the higher stereotyped behavior and depression-like behavior in GluD1 knockout mice. Together these findings demonstrate a critical requirement for GluD1 in normal spine development in the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover  these results identify inhibition of GluN2B-containing receptors as a mechanism for reducing excess dendritic spines and stereotyped behavior which may have therapeutic value in certain neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism."

Here  we chemically distorted those processes using an antidepressant drug-exposure model to generate developmental neurological distortions like those characteristics expressed in autism  and then intensively trained altered young rodents to evaluate the potential for neuroplasticity-driven renormalization. We found that young rats that were injected s.c. with the antidepressant citalopram from postnatal d 1-10 displayed impaired neuronal repetition-rate following capacity in the primary auditory cortex (A1). With a focus on recovering grossly degraded auditory system processing in this model  we showed that targeted temporal processing deficits induced by early-life antidepressant exposure within the A1 were almost completely reversed through implementation of a simple behavioral training strategy (i.e.  a modified go/no-go repetition-rate discrimination task). Degraded parvalbumin inhibitory GABAergic neurons and the fast inhibitory actions that they control were also renormalized by training. Importantly  antidepressant-induced degradation of serotonergic and dopaminergic neuromodulatory systems regulating cortical neuroplasticity was sharply reversed. These findings bear important implications for neuroplasticity-based therapeutics in autistic patients."

The phenotype includes anxiety linked to sensory hyperarousal  hyperactivity  and attentional problems consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and social deficits leading to autism spectrum disorder in 60% of boys and 25% of girls with FXS.RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple targeted treatments for FXS have rescued the phenotype of the fmr1 knockout mouse  but few have been beneficial to patients with FXS. The failure of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonists falls on the heels of the failure of Arbaclofen's efficacy in children and adults with autism or FXS. In contrast  efficacy has been demonstrated in a controlled trial of minocycline in children with FXS. Minocycline lowers the abnormally elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 in FXS. Acamprosate and lovastatin have been beneficial in open-label trials in FXS. The first 5 years of life may be the most efficacious time for intervention when combined with behavioral and/or educational interventions.SUMMARY: Minocycline  acamprosate  lovastatin  and sertraline are treatments that can be currently prescribed and have shown benefit in children with FXS.

This article reviews recent evidence as well as earlier relevant studies regarding the characteristics  assessment  and treatment of anxiety in youth with ASD.RECENT FINDINGS: It is well established that the prevalence of anxiety in youth with an ASD is significantly greater than the prevalence of anxiety in the general population. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of informant  method  and instrument when measuring anxiety in this population. Despite the high prevalence  findings to date have been unable to identify any consistent risk factors for anxiety. New psychological treatments  including modified cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with high functioning ASD and co-occurring anxiety  are emerging. Pharmacological data  however  are scant. Existing studies show that youth with ASD are at increased risk for behavioral activation when taking SSRIs.SUMMARY: Clinicians working with youth with ASD are encouraged to routinely screen for anxiety.

Metabolic adverse events  including weight gain and dyslipidemia  are common. Methylphenidate is effective in reducing attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Atomoxetine and alpha-2 agonists appear effective in reducing ADHD symptoms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not effective in improving repetitive behaviors in children with ASD  and frequently cause activating adverse events. Efficacy of antiepileptic drugs is inconclusive. Overall  efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy in children with ASD are less favorable than data seen in typically developing children with similar symptoms. Newer agents  including glutamatergic agents and oxytocin  appear promising albeit with mixed results.SUMMARY: Current evidence-based pharmacotherapy options in children with ASD are very limited  and many have substantial adverse events. Clinicians should use pharmacotherapy as a part of comprehensive treatment  and judiciously weigh risks and benefits.

Serotonin agonists modulate motor response inhibition and have shown positive behavioural effects in both disorders.AIMS: We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the so far unknown shared and disorder-specific inhibitory brain dysfunctions in these two disorders  as well as the effects of a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine.METHODS: Age-matched boys with ADHD (18)  ASD (19) and healthy controls (25) were compared with fMRI during a stop task measuring motor inhibition. Patients were scanned twice  under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind  placebo-controlled randomised design. Repeated measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. To test for potential normalisation effects of brain dysfunctions  patients under each drug condition were compared to controls.RESULTS: Under placebo  relative to controls  ASD boys showed overactivation in left and right inferior frontal cortex (IFC)  while ADHD boys showed disorder-specific underactivation in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basal ganglia. Under fluoxetine  the prefrontal dysfunctions were no longer observed  due to inverse effects of fluoxetine on these activations: fluoxetine downregulated IFC and OFC activation in ASD but upregulated them in ADHD.CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that fluoxetine normalises frontal lobe dysfunctions in both disorders via inverse effects  downregulating abnormally increased frontal activation in ASD and upregulating abnormally decreased frontal activation in ADHD  potentially reflecting inverse baseline serotonin levels in both disorders."

There are few animal studies focused on long-term behavioral effects of prenatal antidepressant exposure; in addition  studies have not looked at individual differences in baseline affective state as a source of response variability. In this study  fluoxetine  a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)  was administered to male and female rat pups from postnatal days 2-7 to model exposure to antidepressants in the human third trimester. Four behavioral measures were conducted from the neonatal to adult age periods in Low and High lines selectively bred for their rate of ultrasonic vocalizations after brief maternal separation. Neonatal fluoxetine administration decreased distress calls in both lines  but to a greater extent in High line rats than Low line. Neonatal fluoxetine also impaired motor coordination in neonates. Neonatal fluoxetine administration decreased social behavior in both juvenile and adult subjects. Fluoxetine-related reductions in anxiety behavior were not observed at the two older ages. As expected  High line subjects displayed more anxiety behavior than Low line subjects at all three test ages.

Recent reports have suggested that perinatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) resulted in cortical network miswiring  abnormal social behavior  callosal myelin malformation  as well as oligodendrocyte (OL) pathology in rats. To gain further insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SSRIs-induced OL and myelin abnormalities  we investigated the effect of 5-HT exposure on OL development  cell death  and myelination in cell culture models. First  we showed that 5-HT receptor 1A and 2A subtypes were expressed in OL lineages  using immunocytochemistry  Western blot  as well as intracellular Ca(2+) measurement. We then assessed the effect of serotonin exposure on the lineage development  expression of myelin proteins  cell death  and myelination  in purified OL and neuron-OL myelination cultures. For pure OL cultures  our results showed that 5-HT exposure led to disturbance of OL development  as indicated by aberrant process outgrowth and reduced myelin proteins expression. At higher doses  such exposure triggered a development-dependent cell death  as immature OLs exhibited increasing susceptibility to 5-HT treatment compared to OL progenitor cells (OPC). We showed further that 5-HT-induced immature OL death was mediated at least partially via 5-HT2A receptor  since cell death could be mimicked by 5-HT2A receptor agonist 1-(2 5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride  (±)-2 5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride  but atten-uated by pre-treatment with 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ritanserin. Utilizing a neuron-OL myelination co-culture model  our data showed that 5-HT exposure significantly reduced the number of myelinated internodes. In contrast to cell injury observed in pure OL cultures  5-HT exposure did not lead to OL death or reduced OL density in neuron-OL co-cultures. However  abnormal patterns of contactin-associated protein (Caspr) clustering were observed at the sites of Node of Ranvier  suggesting that 5-HT exposure may affect other axon-derived factors for myelination. In summary  this is the first study to demonstrate that manipulation of serotonin levels affects OL development and myelination  which may contribute to altered neural connectivity noted in SSRIs-treated animals. The current in vitro study demonstrated that exposure to high level of serotonin (5-HT) led to aberrant oligodendrocyte (OL) development  cell injury  and myelination deficit. We propose that elevated extracellular serotonin levels in the fetal brain  such as upon the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy  may adversely affect OL development and/or myelination  thus contributing to altered neural connectivity seen in Autism Spectrum Disorders.

We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate shared and disorder-specific brain dysfunctions of WM in these disorders  and the effects of a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine.METHOD: Age-matched boys with ADHD (n = 17)  ASD (n = 17) and controls (n = 22) were compared using fMRI during an N-back WM task. Patients were scanned twice  under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind  placebo-controlled randomized design. Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects on performance and brain function. To test for normalization effects of brain dysfunctions  patients under each drug condition were compared to controls.RESULTS: Under placebo  relative to controls  both ADHD and ASD boys shared underactivation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fluoxetine significantly normalized the DLPFC underactivation in ASD relative to controls whereas it increased posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) deactivation in ADHD relative to control boys. Within-patient analyses showed inverse effects of fluoxetine on PCC deactivation  which it enhanced in ADHD and decreased in ASD.CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that fluoxetine modulates brain activation during WM in a disorder-specific manner by normalizing task-positive DLPFC dysfunction in ASD boys and enhancing task-negative default mode network (DMN) deactivation in ADHD."

SLC6A4  the gene encoding serotonin transporter (SERT) is considered as a potential susceptibility gene for ASD  since it is a quantitative trait locus for blood 5-HT levels. Three functional polymorphisms  5-HTTLPR  STin2 and 3'UTR-SNP of SLC6A4 are extensively studied for possible association with the disorder  with inconclusive outcome. In the present study  we investigated association of these polymorphisms with platelet 5-HT content and symptoms severity as revealed by childhood autism rating scale in ASD children from an Indian population. Higher 5-HT level observed in ASD was highly significant in children with heterozygous and homozygous genotypes comprising of minor alleles of the markers. Quantitative transmission disequilibrium test demonstrated significant genetic effect of STin2 allele as well as STin2/3'UTR-SNP and 5-HTTLPR/3'UTR-SNP haplotypes on 5-HT levels  but no direct association with overall CARS score and ASD phenotype. Significant genetic effect of the markers on specific behavioral phenotypes was observed for various sub-phenotypes of CARS in quantitative trait analysis. Even though the 5-HT level was not associated with severity of behavioral CARS score  a significant negative relationship was observed for 5-HT levels and level and consistency of intellectual response and general impression in ASD children. Population-based study revealed higher distribution of the haplotype 10/G of STin2/3'UTR-SNP in male controls  suggesting protective effect of this haplotype in male cases. Overall results of the study suggest that SLC6A4 markers have specific genetic effect on individual ASD behavioral attributes  might be through the modulation of 5-HT content."

It remains difficult to know whether the modest increase in risk is due to the medication  to the mood disorder itself  or to other confounding factors. For any individual woman the decision to commence or continue antidepressant medication in pregnancy must be made after a full consideration of the potential risks and benefits of all options  including non-pharmacological treatments.

However  two case-control studies suggested an association between prenatal SSRI exposure with childhood autism.AIMS: To prospectively determine whether intra-uterine SSSRI exposure is associated with childhood autistic symptoms in a population-based study.METHOD: A total of 376 children prenatally exposed to maternal depressive symptoms (no SSRI exposure)  69 children prenatally exposed to SSRIs and 5531 unexposed children were included. Child pervasive developmental and affective problems were assessed by parental report with the Child Behavior Checklist at ages 1.5  3 and 6. At age 6  we assessed autistic traits using the Social Responsiveness Scale (n = 4264).RESULTS: Prenatal exposure to maternal depressive symptoms without SSRIs was related to both pervasive developmental (odds ratio (OR) = 1.44  95% CI 1.07-1.93) and affective problems (OR = 1.44  95% CI 1.15-1.81). Compared with unexposed children  those prenatally exposed to SSRIs also were at higher risk for developing pervasive developmental problems (OR = 1.91  95% CI 1.13-3.47)  but not for affective problems. Children prenatally exposed to SSRIs also had more autistic traits (B = 0.15  95% CI 0.08-0.22) compared with those exposed to depressive symptoms only.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an association between prenatal SSRI exposure and autistic traits in children. Prenatal depressive symptoms without SSRI use were also associated with autistic traits  albeit this was weaker and less specific. Long-term drug safety trials are needed before evidence-based recommendations are possible."

Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for categorical outcomes. SMDs of individual cognitive tests were pooled on a study level within domains (primary outcome) and across domains. When results were heterogeneous  random instead of fixed effects models were used.RESULTS: We meta-analyzed 11 studies (duration = 8.7 ± 3.7 weeks) including 568 patients (mean age = 39.5 ± 6.9 years  males = 67.2%  illness duration = 12.5 ± 8.0 years). Antidepressants included mirtazapine (4 studies; n = 126)  citalopram (2 studies; n = 231)  fluvoxamine (1 study; n = 47)  duloxetine (1 study; n = 40)  mianserin (1 study; n = 30)  bupropion (1 study; n = 61)  and reboxetine (1 study; n = 33). Statistically significant  but clinically negligible  advantages were found for pooled antidepressants compared to placebo in executive function (Hedges' g = 0.17  p = 0.02) and a composite cognition score (Hedges' g = 0.095  p = 0.012). Depression improved with serotonergic antidepressants (p = 0.0009) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (p = 0.009)  but not with pooled antidepressants (p = 0.39). Sedation was more common with pooled antidepressants (p = 0.04).CONCLUSION: Adjunctive antidepressants do not demonstrate clinically significant effects on cognition in schizophrenia patients  however  larger studies  preferably in euthymic schizophrenia patients and using full neurocognitive batteries  are needed to confirm this finding."

The current literature shows growing evidence of a high rate of comorbidity between AS and other psychiatric disorders  particularly Bipolar Disorder (BD). We reviewed available epidemiological and clinical data on BD-AS comorbidity and its diagnostic and therapeutic implicationsMETHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted through PubMed  Scopus and Psych-Info using combinations of the following search terms: Asperger<U+05F3>s Syndrome  Bipolar Disorder  depression  mood disorder  psychiatric comorbidity  treatment  mood stabilizers  anticonvulsants  antipsychotics  and antidepressants.RESULTS: BD prevalence in adults with AS ranges from 6% to 21.4% of the cases. Relatives of patients with AS showed a doubled risk of being affected by BD and a BD prevalence near to 10%. When comorbid with AS  BD assumes peculiar features which might shape its under-recognition or misdiagnosis (especially schizophrenia when psychotic symptoms are prominent). Although controlled data on pharmacological treatments in BD-AS comorbidity are substantially lacking  information is derived by open observations  case series and chart reviews. Mood stabilizers should be considered the first choice  and antipsychotics  especially second generation drugs (SGA) with 5-HT2a antagonism  have been shown useful in controlling psychotic and behavioral symptoms and improving social withdrawal. Some evidence of efficacy for the treatment of anxiety  obsessive-compulsive symptoms and depression is reported for SSRI antidepressants. The use of these drugs should be carefully monitored  because activation with hypomanic or manic switches is reported up to 54% of the treated subjects.CONCLUSION: BD in AS patients is frequent  usually it onsets during adolescence and is often characterized by atypical presentation  making its correct identification particularly difficult. A correct diagnosis of BD in AS individuals has relevant implications on the choice of adequate psychopharmacological  psycho-social and rehabilitative treatments."

Studies making comparisons among women taking antidepressants for any reason and those not taking antidepressants (depression status unknown) were used to fill gaps in the evidence.TABULATION  INTEGRATION  AND RESULTS: Dual study data extraction and quality assessment were used. Six randomized controlled trials and 15 observational studies provided evidence. Low-strength evidence suggested neonates of pregnant women with depression taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors had higher risk of respiratory distress than did neonates of untreated women (13.9% compared with 7.8%; P&lt;.001) but no difference in risk of neonatal convulsions (0.14% compared with 0.11%; P=.64) or preterm birth (17% compared with 10%; P=.07). Indirect evidence from studies of pregnant women receiving antidepressants for mixed or unreported reasons compared with pregnant women not taking antidepressants (depression status unknown) suggested future research should focus on congenital anomalies and autism spectrum and attention deficit disorders in the child. In postpartum depression  low-strength evidence suggested symptom response was not improved when sertraline was added to psychotherapy or when cognitive-behavioral therapy was added to paroxetine. Evidence was insufficient for other outcomes  including depression symptoms  functional capacity  breastfeeding  and infant and child development. A serious limitation is the lack of study populations of exclusively depressed pregnant and postpartum women.CONCLUSION: Evidence about the comparative benefits and harms of pharmacologic treatment of depression in pregnant and postpartum women was largely inadequate to allow informed decisions about treatment. Considering the prevalence of depression  filling this gap is essential."

These polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with depression symptom severity and response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs in adults with diagnosed depressive disorder.METHODS: Parents of 104 children with autism spectrum disorder rated their children's depressive symptoms using a validated scale based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  4th edition. We compared severity of depression symptoms across the rs6311 and rs6314 genotypes  measured from the children's genomic DNA.RESULTS: Children homozygous for the G allele of rs6311 had significantly more severe depression symptoms than those with G/A or A/A genotypes (P=0.025). The effect size (partial eta-squared) was small (<U+03B7>p=0.047) but was somewhat larger when we controlled for severity of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms (P=0.006  <U+03B7>p=0.072). When we restricted our analyses to white participants  our results were essentially the same as for the entire sample (P=0.004  <U+03B7>p=0.086). There was no significant association between rs6314 (C/C versus T carriers) and severity of depression.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the HTR2A functional rs6311 polymorphism  which other studies have associated with differential HTR2A mRNA expression  may modulate the severity of depression symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder. These tentative  hypothesis-generating findings need replication with larger  independent samples."

To date  clinical trials examining the use of SSRIs in autism have been limited by small sample sizes and inconclusive results. The efficacy and safety of SSRIs for moderating autistic behaviors is yet to be adequately examined to provide evidence to support current clinical practice. The aim of the Fluoxetine for Autistic Behaviors (FAB) study is to determine the efficacy and safety of low dose fluoxetine compared with placebo  for reducing the frequency and severity of repetitive stereotypic behaviors in children and adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The relationship between the effectiveness of fluoxetine treatment and serotonin transporter genotype will also be explored.DESIGN: The FAB study is a multicenter  double-blinded  randomized controlled trial  funded by the Australian Government's National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) grant. Participants will be aged between 7.5 and 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD. Eligible participants will be randomized to either placebo or fluoxetine for a 16-week period. Medication will be titrated over the first four weeks. Reponses to medication will be monitored fortnightly using the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI). The primary outcome measure is the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (CYBOCS-PDD)  administered at baseline and 16 weeks. Secondary outcome measures include the Aberrant Behaviour Scale (ABC)  the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale Parent Report (SCAS-P)  and the Repetitive Behaviors Scale (RBS-R)  measured at baseline and 16 weeks. Participants will be invited to undergo genetic testing for SLC6A4 allele variants using a cheek swab. Continuous outcomes  including the primary outcome will be compared between the active and placebo groups using unadjusted linear regression. Binary outcomes will be compared using unadjusted logistic regression.DISCUSSION: The FAB study is a large clinical trial to specifically investigate the efficacy of low dose fluoxetine for restricted  repetitive  and stereotyped behaviors in ASD.

Standardized measures confirmed developmental status. Interviews with biological mothers ascertained prenatal SSRI use  maternal mental health history  and sociodemographic information.RESULTS: Overall  prevalence of prenatal SSRI exposure was lowest in TD children (3.4%) but did not differ significantly from ASD (5.9%) or DD (5.2%) children. Among boys  prenatal SSRI exposure was nearly 3 times as likely in children with ASD relative to TD (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-7.93); the strongest association occurred with first-trimester exposure (OR: 3.22; 95% CI: 1.17-8.84).

Findings were similar among mothers with an anxiety or mood disorder history.CONCLUSIONS: In boys  prenatal exposure to SSRIs may increase susceptibility to ASD or DD. Findings from published studies on SSRIs and ASD continues to be inconsistent. Potential recall bias and residual confounding by indication are concerns. Larger samples are needed to replicate DD results.

The disease is primarily caused by the loss of function of maternally inherited UBE3A. Ube3a maternal-deficient mice recapitulates many essential feature of AS. These AS mice have been shown to be under chronic stress and exhibits anxiety-like behaviour because of defective glucocorticoid receptor signalling. Here  we demonstrate that chronic stress in these mice could lead to down-regulation of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala from early post-natal days. Down-regulation of parvalbumin-positive interneurons number could be because of decrease in the expression of parvalbumin in these neurons. We also find that treatment with fluoxetine  a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  results in restoration of impaired glucocorticoid signalling  elevated serum corticosterone level  parvalbumin-positive interneurons and anxiety-like behaviours. Our findings suggest that impaired glucocorticod signalling in hippocampus and amygdala of AS mice is critical for the decrease in parvalbumin interneurons number  emergence of anxiety and other behavioural deficits and highlights the importance of fluoxetine in the recovery of these abnormalities."

Thus  this study investigates shared and disorder-specific brain dysfunctions in these 2 disorders during reward reversal  and the acute effects of an SSRI on these. Age-matched boys with ADHD (15)  ASD (18)  and controls (21) were compared with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a reversal task.

A Review of the Perinatal and Labor Risk Factors and Autism.","Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder marked by severe deficits in social communication and interactions. It is a complex condition that lacks an established preventive method  warranting a need for research to identify possible environmental triggers. The identification of external factors particularly perinatal risk factors forms the initial critical step in preventing and alleviating risks. We conducted a literature review to assess evidence suggested in the worldwide literature. Perinatal risk factors that have a suggested association include ß2 adrenergic receptor agonists  labor induction and augmentation  maternal infection and disease (i.e.  antiphospholipid syndrome)  antiepileptic drugs  cocaine use  and oral supplements. Smoking has not been found to have a direct association. Pollutants  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  artificial insemination  and fertility medications may have a link  but results are often conflicted. Factors related to the delivery room experience may be associated with meconium aspiration syndrome  birth weight  and labor time. Several risk factors during the pregnancy and labor periods have been associated with autism; yet further studies with large populations are needed to establish definitive associations. The fact that several risk factors during the prenatal and labor periods are implicated in autism should prompt the medical community to focus on the pregnancy and labor periods as preventive measures to curb the incidence of autism."
"69","25823351","[Current evaluation of teratogenic and fetotoxic effects of psychotropic drugs].","Psychiatric disorders are equally common among pregnant and non-pregnant women  and many of these conditions are treated with psychotropic medications. The use of psychotropic medicines during pregnancy  especially antidepressants  became increasingly prevalent in the early 2000's  although many physicians prefer not to prescribe drugs for pregnant women due to concerns about teratogenicity. Current data on the risks of in utero exposure to psychotropic medications are limited  leaving women and physicians to make difficult decisions regarding the initiation or maintenance of treatment during pregnancy without a complete knowledge of the risks. Of all the psychotropics  antidepressant use in pregnancy has been relatively well studied. However  available studies have not yet adequately controlled for other factors that may influence birth outcomes  including maternal illness or problematic health-related behaviors such as smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy. This review focuses on the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy  the antidepressants most commonly used to treat depression. In the evaluation of medication during pregnancy  teratogenicity and fetotoxicity must be considered. Most studies on the use of SSRIs during the first trimester of pregnancy have not shown an increase in the overall risk of major malformations  although several studies have suggested that SSRIs may be associated with a small increased risk of cardiovascular malformations  mainly involving ventricular and atrial septal defects. In addition to structural malformations  drugs were also observed to induce other adverse effects. Since SSRIs readily cross the placenta  concern has been raised about the short- or long-term effects of prenatal exposure to SSRIs on the developing offspring. Epidemiological studies have documented that 10-30% of neonates exposed to SSRIs near term had poor neonatal adaptation syndrome (PNAS). Some studies reported that persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is weakly associated with in utero antidepressant exposure  while no association has been reported in other studies. Recent studies have raised questions about possible associations with antidepressant use during pregnancy and long-term effects on neurobehavioral development. Some individual studies have suggested associations between prenatal exposure to antidepressants and autism spectrum disorder; however  other studies identified no associations. On the other hand  depressive symptoms during pregnancy are also associated with increased risks of preterm delivery  fetal growth retardation  and postpartum depression. Therefore  the effects of untreated maternal depression on both maternal and child outcomes must be taken into consideration when making treatment decisions. Future research needs to focus on large prospective studies with adequate adjustments for key potential confounding factors  including maternal mental illness  other exposures  and an adequate length of follow-up  in order to obtain accurate child developmental outcomes."

It is estimated more than 60/100 000 children are suffering from PDD. Comorbid disorders are common in people with PDD  including intellectual deficiency  symptoms of attention deficit-hyperactivity  aggression and disruption  and pervasive repetitive behaviours or thoughts. These symptoms have a negative impact on the outcome and quality of life of the patients and their caregivers. The first-line management of comorbid disorders in PDD is behavioural intervention  but sometimes this is not sufficient  and the use of pharmacological treatment is needed.METHOD: We conducted a review of studies of medical treatments used in patients with PDD to establish which treatments show good evidence of efficacy in PDD. We used the Medline database and the following keywords &quot;pervasive development disorders&quot; or &quot;autism spectrum disorders&quot; or &quot;autistic disorder&quot; and &quot;therapy&quot; or &quot;treatment&quot;.RESULTS: The treatments that showed the best efficacy on irritability in well-designed studies are second generation antipsychotics  risperidone and aripiprazole. Some studies indicate that haloperidol is efficient as well  but the very high frequency of extra-pyramidal effects limits its use. Methylphenidate has shown some efficacy on impulsivity and hyperactivity in randomised placebo-controlled studies. First data concerning atomoxetine are promising but better-designed studies are needed. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors: fluvoxamine and fluoxetine have shown some efficacy in the treatment of serious and pervasive repetitive behaviours. Alpha-adrenergic treatments  clonidine and guanfacine  can help in the management of disruptive behaviours in patients with PDD. Data concerning naltrexone are contradictory  indeed many case reports of its efficacy on aggressive (mostly auto-aggressive) behaviours are reported in the literature  but well-designed studies do not find any improvement in patients treated with naltrexone compared with patients treated with placebo. First data concerning ocytocin are promising  indeed  if they were to be confirmed  that would be the first treatment efficient on the core symptoms of PDD."
"71","24359174","Plasma oxytocin changes and anti-obsessive response during serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment: a placebo controlled study.","BACKGROUND: The drug treatments of choice for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). However  a correlation between the neuropeptide oxytocin in cerebrospinal fluid and the severity of OCD has previously been shown  and oxytocin and serotonin are interconnected within the brain. Few studies have investigated whether SRIs have any effect on oxytocin; thus  our aim was to explore the possibility that oxytocinergic mechanisms contribute to the anti-obsessive effect of SRIs.METHOD: In a randomized  double-blind trial  comparing SRIs (clomipramine and paroxetine) with placebo in 36 adults with OCD (characterized for subtypes)  plasma oxytocin was measured with radioimmunoassay after plasma extraction  at baseline  after 1 week  and after 4 weeks of treatment  and related to baseline severity and clinical response after 12 weeks  as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS).RESULTS: Baseline oxytocin levels correlated positively with baseline Y-BOCS ratings  but only among the future SRI responders. Patients with early onset of OCD had higher baseline oxytocin. During treatment  plasma oxytocin did not differ between SRI and placebo treatment. In SRI responders  plasma oxytocin first decreased and then increased; in non-responders (to SRI as well as to placebo)  the reverse was the case. After 4 weeks  treatment responders had attained higher oxytocin levels compared to non-responders. The intra-individual range (i.e.  the variability) of plasma oxytocin between measurements was the measure that best differentiated responders from non-responders. This range was higher in responders than non-responders  and lower in patients with autistic traits.CONCLUSIONS: SRIs have highly variable effects on plasma oxytocin between individuals. The associations between baseline oxytocin and OCD severity and between oxytocin changes and treatment response support the notions that oxytocin is involved in OCD pathophysiology  and that the anti-obsessive effects of SRIs are partly exerted through oxytocinergic mechanisms."

Using Danish population registries  we linked information on maternal use of SSRIs before and during pregnancy  autism spectrum disorders diagnosed in the offspring  and a range of potential confounders.

Among women who received SSRIs before pregnancy but not during pregnancy  the corresponding fully adjusted rate ratio was 1.46 (95% CI  1.17 to 1.81).CONCLUSIONS: We did not detect a significant association between maternal use of SSRIs during pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder in the offspring. On the basis of the upper boundary of the confidence interval  our study could not rule out a relative risk up to 1.61  and therefore the association warrants further study.

Deficits in cognitive flexibility and perseverative behaviors are shared common symptoms in these disorders. However  little is known about the impact of Tph2 gene variants on cognition. Mice expressing a human TPH2 variant (Tph2-KI) were used to investigate cognitive consequences of TPH2 loss of function and pharmacological treatments. We applied a recently developed behavioral assay  the automated H-maze  to study cognitive functions in Tph2-KI mice. This assay involves the consecutive discovery of three different rules: a delayed alternation task  a non-alternation task  and a delayed reversal task. Possible contribution of locomotion  reward  and sensory perception were also investigated. The expression of loss-of-function mutant Tph2 in mice was associated with impairments in reversal learning and cognitive flexibility  accompanied by perseverative behaviors similar to those observed in human clinical studies. Pharmacological restoration of 5-HT synthesis with 5-hydroxytryptophan or treatment with the 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist CP809.101 reduced cognitive deficits in Tph2-KI mice and abolished perseveration. In contrast  treatment with the psychostimulant methylphenidate exacerbated cognitive deficits in mutant mice. Results from this study suggest a contribution of TPH2 in the regulation of cognition. Furthermore  identification of a role for a 5-HT(2) receptor agonist as a cognition-enhancing agent in mutant mice suggests a potential avenue to explore for the personalized treatment of cognitive symptoms in humans with reduced 5-HT synthesis and TPH2 polymorphisms."
"75","24100941","Neuroligin modulates the locomotory dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal pathways of C. elegans.","Neuroligins are neuronal and neuromuscular transmembrane proteins that have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder and other cognitive diseases. The nlg-1 gene from Caenorhabditis elegans is orthologous to human neuroligin genes. In the nematode  the locomotory rate is mediated by dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways  which result in two different behavioral responses known as basal slowing response (BSR) and enhanced slowing response (ESR)  respectively. We report that nlg-1-deficient mutants are defective in both the BSR and ESR behaviors. In addition  we demonstrate that methylphenidate (a dopamine reuptake inhibitor) and fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor)  two drugs widely used for the treatment of behavioral disorders in humans  are able to restore the BSR and ESR wild type phenotypes  respectively  in nlg-1 defective mutant nematodes. The abnormal locomotory behavior patterns were rescued in nlg-1-deficient mutant by expressing a cDNA from the human NLGN1 gene under the C. elegans nlg-1 promoter. However  human NLGN1 (R453C) and NLGN1 (D432X) mutant alleles did not rescue any of the two mutant phenotypes. The results indicate that neuroligin is involved in modulating the action of dopamine and serotonin in the nematode and suggest that the functional mechanism underpinning both methylphenidate and fluoxetine in C. elegans might be comparable to that in humans. The neuroligin-deficient mutants may undergo inefficient synaptic transmissions which could affect different traits in the nervous system. In particular  neuroligin might be required for normal neurotransmitters release. The understanding of the mechanisms by which methylphenidate and fluoxetine are able to restore the behavior of these mutants could help to explain the etiology of some human neurological diseases."

Some evidence suggestive of variations in bioavailability and clinical effectiveness between different formulations make policy decisions occasionally difficult. The use of generic olanzapine is a widely acceptable practice on the basis of quality  safety and efficacy data and has been adopted in several countries.CASE PRESENTATION: The case of a 14 year old boy with bipolar affective disorder  autism and intellectual disability who had brand-name to generic olanzapine switch associated with rapid deterioration of his mental state is described. This clinical change was not related to any physical illness or other medication adjustment and resolved as rapidly when generic olanzapine was switched back to the brand-name formulation.CONCLUSIONS: Caution should be exercised when policy for switching from brand-name to generic psychotropic medications are made  especially when using medications off label  in extremes of age and in those patients with co-morbid complicating factors such as intellectual disability."

Convergent evidence from genetic analyses of human subjects has implicated the integrin ß3 subunit gene (ITGB3) as a modulator of serotonergic systems via genetic interactions with the 5-HT transporter gene (SLC6A4  SERT). While genetic interactions may result from contributions of each gene at several levels  we hypothesize that ITGB3 modulates the 5-HT system at the level of the synapse  through the actions of integrin avß3. Here we utilized a genetic approach in mouse models to examine Itgb3 contributions to SERT function both in the context of normal and reduced SERT expression. As integrin avß3 is expressed in postsynaptic membranes  we isolated synaptoneurosomes  which maintain intact pre- and post-synaptic associations. Citalopram binding revealed significant Slc6a4-driven reductions in SERT expression in midbrain synapses  whereas no significant changes were observed in hippocampal or cortical projections. Expecting corresponding changes to SERT function  we also measured 5-HT uptake activity in synaptoneurosomal preparations. Itgb3 single heterozygous mice displayed significant reductions in 5-HT Vmax  with no changes in Km  in midbrain preparations. However  in the presence of both Itgb3 and Slc6a4 heterozygozity  5-HT uptake was similar to wild-type levels  revealing a significant Slc6a4 by Itgb3 genetic interaction in the midbrain. Similar findings were observed in cortical preparations  whereas in the hippocampus  most Vmax changes were driven solely by Slc6a4. Our findings provide evidence that integrin avß3 is involved in the regulation of serotonergic systems in some  but not all 5-HT synapses  revealing novel contributions to synaptic specificity within the central nervous system."

However  there is considerable variability in the behaviors of different individuals with an ASD diagnosis. The heterogeneity spans the entire range of IQ and language abilities  as well as other behavioral  communicative  and social functions. While any psychiatric condition is likely to incorporate a degree of heterogeneity  the variability in the nature and severity of behaviors observed in ASD is thought to exceed that of other disorders. The current paper aims to provide a model for future research into ASD subgroups. In doing so  we examined whether two proposed risk factors - low birth weight (LBW)  and in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - are associated with greater behavioral homogeneity. Using data from the Western Australian Autism Biological Registry  this study found that LBW and maternal SSRI use during pregnancy were associated with greater sleep disturbances and a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with ASD  respectively. The findings from this &quot;proof of principle&quot; paper provide support for this &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach as a feasible method for creating homogenous groups."

Baseline data at study entry were examined with respect to final outcome to determine if response predictors could be identified. A total of 149 children and adolescents 5 to 17 years of age (mean [SD] age  9.4 [3.1] years) from 6 academic centers were randomly assigned to citalopram (n = 73) or placebo (n = 76). Participants had autistic disorder  Asperger syndrome  or pervasive developmental disorder  not otherwise specified; had illness severity ratings that were moderate or more than moderate on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale; and scored moderate or more than moderate on compulsive behaviors measured with the modified Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale.INTERVENTIONS: Twelve weeks of treatment with citalopram (10 mg/5 mL) or placebo. The mean (SD) maximum dose of citalopram was 16.5 (6.5) mg by mouth daily (maximum dose  20 mg/d).MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A positive response was defined as having a score of at least much improved on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale at week 12. Baseline measures included demographic (sex  age  weight  and pubertal status)  clinical  and family measures. Clinical variables included baseline illness severity ratings (the Aberrant Behavior Checklist  the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory  the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales  the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised  and the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale). Family measures included the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire.RESULTS: Several baseline predictors of response were identified  and a principal component analysis yielded 3 composite measures (disruptive behavior  autism/mood  and caregiver strain) that significantly predicted response at week 12. Specifically  participants in the placebo group were significantly less likely than participants in the citalopram group to respond at week 12 if they entered the study more symptomatic on each of the 3 composite measures  and they were at least 2 times less likely to be responders.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This analysis suggests strategies that may be useful in anticipating and potentially mitigating the nonspecific response in randomized clinical trials of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00086645."

We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). This was supplemented by searching reference lists and contacting known experts in the field.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any dose of oral SSRI compared with placebo  in people with ASD.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion  extracted data and appraised each study's risk of bias.MAIN RESULTS: Nine RCTs with a total of 320 participants were included. Four SSRIs were evaluated: fluoxetine (three studies)  fluvoxamine (two studies)  fenfluramine (two studies) and citalopram (two studies). Five studies included only children and four studies included only adults. Varying inclusion criteria were used with regard to diagnostic criteria and intelligence quotient of participants. Eighteen different outcome measures were reported. Although more than one study reported data for Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and obsessive-compulsive behaviour (OCB)  different tool types or components of these outcomes were used in each study. As such  data were unsuitable for meta-analysis  except for one outcome (proportion improvement). One large  high-quality study in children showed no evidence of positive effect of citalopram. Three small studies in adults showed positive outcomes for CGI and OCB; one study showed improvements in aggression  and another in anxiety.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of effect of SSRIs in children and emerging evidence of harm. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of SSRIs in adults from small studies in which risk of bias is unclear."

The Broader Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) was used to measure the BAP of 275 parents. Fathers not taking SSRIs (F-SSRI; n = 115) scored significantly higher on BAP Total and Aloof subscales compared to mothers not receiving treatment (M-SSRI; n = 136.) However  mothers taking SSRIs (M + SSRI; n = 19) scored higher than those not taking medication on BAP Total and Rigid subscales  and they were more likely to be BAPQ Total  Aloof  and Rigid positive. Significant correlations were noted between proband autism symptoms and parental BAPQ scores such that Total  Aloof  and Rigid subscale scores of F-SSRI correlated with proband restricted repetitive behavior (RRB) measures on the ADOS  CRI  and RBS-R. However  only the Aloof subscale score of M + SSRI correlated with proband RRB on the ADOS. The correlation between the BAPQ scores of mothers taking SSRIs and child scores  as well as the increase in BAPQ scores of this group of mothers  requires careful interpretation and further study because correlations would not withstand multiple corrections. As expected by previous research  significant parent-child correlations were observed for 5HT levels. However  5HT levels were not correlated with behavioral measures.

Pyridoxine was not able to reduce (p &gt; 0.05) TNF-a in the astrocyte culture. Antidepressant (sertraline) showed positive effects (increased IL-10 and reduced TNF-a level) possibly through the suppression of Th1 lymphocytes and monocytes and stimulation of Th2 lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages. NSAID (diclofenac) showed positive immune regulation effect possibly through the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase enzyme.

Abnormalities in social-emotional behaviors are a core deficit in autism  and are characterized by impaired reciprocal-social interaction  lack of facial expressions  and the inability to recognize familiar faces. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and fusiform gyrus (FG) are two regions within an extensive limbic-cortical network that contribute to social-emotional behaviors. Evidence indicates that changes in brains of individuals with autism begin prenatally. Serotonin (5-HT) is one of the earliest expressed neurotransmitters  and plays an important role in synaptogenesis  neurite outgrowth  and neuronal migration. Abnormalities in 5-HT systems have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders  including autism  as evidenced by immunology  imaging  genetics  pharmacotherapy  and neuropathology. Although information is known regarding peripheral 5-HT in autism  there is emerging evidence that 5-HT systems in the central nervous system  including various 5-HT receptor subtypes and transporters  are affected in autism. The present study demonstrated significant reductions in 5-HT1A receptor-binding density in superficial and deep layers of the PCC and FG  and in the density of 5-HT(2A) receptors in superficial layers of the PCC and FG. A significant reduction in the density of serotonin transporters (5-HTT) was also found in the deep layers of the FG  but normal levels were demonstrated in both layers of the PCC and superficial layers of the FG. This study provides potential substrates for decreased 5-HT modulation/innervation in the autism brain  and implicate two 5-HT receptor subtypes as potential neuromarkers for novel or existing pharmacotherapies."

The serotonergic system is one of the earliest to develop during embryogenesis and early changes in serotonin levels can have large consequences for the correct development of specific brain areas. The regulation and functioning of serotonin is influenced by genetic risk factors  such as the serotonin transporter polymorphism in humans. This polymorphism is associated with anxiety-related symptoms  changes in social behavior  and cortical gray and white matter changes also seen in patients suffering from autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The human polymorphism can be mimicked by the knockout of the serotonin transporter in rodents  which are as a model system therefore vital to explore the precise neurobiological mechanisms. Moreover  there are pharmacological challenges influencing serotonin in early life  like prenatal/neonatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in depressed pregnant women. There is accumulating evidence that this dysregulation of serotonin during critical phases of brain development can lead to ASD-related symptoms in children  and reduced social behavior and increased anxiety in rodents. Furthermore  prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure  a mood stabilizing drug which is also thought to interfere with serotonin levels  has the potency to induce ASD-like symptoms and to affect the development of the serotonergic system. Here  we review and compare the neurodevelopmental and behavioral consequences of serotonin transporter gene variation  and prenatal SSRI and VPA exposure in the context of ASD."

Whether prenatal SSRI exposure has an effect on neurodevelopment and behavior in the offspring is an important area of investigation.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to review the existing preclinical and clinical literature of prenatal SSRI exposure on serotonin-related behaviors and markers in the offspring. The goal is to determine if there is a signal in the literature that could guide clinical care and/or inform research.RESULTS: Preclinical studies (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>4) showed SSRI exposure during development enhanced depression-like behavior. Half of rodent studies examining anxiety-like behavior (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>13) noted adverse effects with SSRI exposure. A majority of studies of social behavior (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>4) noted a decrease in sociability in SSRI exposed offspring. Human studies (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>4) examining anxiety in the offspring showed no adverse effects of prenatal SSRI exposure. The outcome of one study suggested that children with autism were more likely to have a mother who was prescribed an SSRI during pregnancy.CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical findings in rodents exposed to SSRIs during development point to an increase in depression- and anxiety-like behavior and alteration in social behaviors in the offspring  though both the methods used and the findings were not uniform. These data are not robust enough to discourage use of SSRIs during human pregnancy  particularly given the known adverse effects of maternal mental illness on pregnancy outcomes and infant neurodevelopment. Future research should focus on consistent animal models and prospective human studies with larger samples."

Recent studies have demonstrated altered raphe-derived 5HT transporter (SERT) immunoreactive axonal expression in several cortical target sites after brief perinatal exposure to selective 5HT reuptake inhibitors such as citalopram (CTM). Since the serotonergic raphe nuclear complex projects to the olfactory bulb (OB) and perinatal 5HT disruption has been shown to disrupt olfactory behaviors  the goal of this study was to further investigate such developmental effects in the OB of CTM exposed animals. Male and female rat pups were exposed to CTM from postnatal day 8-21. After animals reach adulthood (&gt;90 days)  OB tissue sections were processed immunohistochemically for SERT antiserum. Our data revealed that the density of the SERT immunoreactive fibers decreased ~40% in the OB of CTM exposed male rats  but not female rats. Our findings support a broad and long-lasting change throughout most of the 5HT system  including the OB  after early manipulation of 5HT. Because dysfunction of the early 5HT system has been implicated in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)  these new findings may offer insight into the abnormal olfactory perception often noted in patients with ASD."

Maternal antidepressant use  recorded at the first antenatal interview  was available for children born from 1995 onwards.RESULTS: A history of maternal (adjusted odds ratio 1.49  95% confidence interval 1.08 to 2.08) but not paternal depression was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders in offspring. In the subsample with available data on drugs  this association was confined to women reporting antidepressant use during pregnancy (3.34  1.50 to 7.47  P=0.003)  irrespective of whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors were reported. All associations were higher in cases of autism without intellectual disability  there being no evidence of an increased risk of autism with intellectual disability. Assuming an unconfounded  causal association  antidepressant use during pregnancy explained 0.6% of the cases of autism spectrum disorder.CONCLUSIONS: In utero exposure to both SSRIs and non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors (tricyclic antidepressants) was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders  particularly without intellectual disability. Whether this association is causal or reflects the risk of autism with severe depression during pregnancy requires further research. However  assuming causality  antidepressant use during pregnancy is unlikely to have contributed significantly towards the dramatic increase in observed prevalence of autism spectrum disorders as it explained less than 1% of cases."

Repeated findings of elevated platelet serotonin levels in approximately one third of children with autism has led some to believe that dysfunctional serotonin signaling may be a causal mechanism for the disorder. Because serotonin is critical to fetal brain development  concerns have arisen regarding prenatal exposure to substances that manipulate serotonin levels  such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This review examines evidence regarding the serotonin system and autism spectrum disorders (ASD)  as well as what the literature has reported thus far on developmental effects of prenatal exposure to SSRIs. Possible mechanisms by which SSRIs could affect the fetus during pregnancy and clinical implications are also discussed. Though the majority of studies conducted in infants and children suggest prenatal exposure to SSRIs does not affect neurodevelopment  interpretation must be tempered given small sample sizes. The only published study that focused on prenatal SSRI exposure and ASD found an increased risk with exposure to SSRIs  especially during the first trimester. Obstacles that will be faced in future research are isolating medication effects from maternal depression and  given the infrequent occurrence of exposure and outcome  obtaining an adequate sample size. Whether serotonin is an etiologic factor in ASD  and what it points to as a marker for subgrouping  remains unclear.

Overall  SRIs are less efficacious and more poorly tolerated in children with ASDs than in adults. Antipsychotics are the most efficacious drugs for the treatment of irritability in ASDs  and may be useful in the treatment of other symptoms. Psychostimulants demonstrate some benefit for the treatment of hyperactivity and inattention in individuals with ASDs  but are less efficacious and associated with more adverse effects compared with individuals with ADHD. D-cycloserine and memantine appear helpful in the treatment of social impairment  although further research is needed."

Although a number of studies have assessed their safety  data concerning congenital malformations and adverse perinatal outcome are conflicting.METHODS: Literature search in PubMed until March 31  2012  including original research articles  meta-analyses  and reviews.RESULTS: Fluoxetine and paroxetine use in early pregnancy has been associated with a small increased risk for specific cardiovascular malformations in some studies  fluoxetine with ventricular septal defects and paroxetine with right ventricular outflow tract defects. The observed absolute risk for these specific malformations is small. Data on preterm birth  low birth weight  and being small for gestational age have been conflicting; and mother's underlying depression is obviously an important confounder. Respiratory distress and neonatal adaptation problems are common in prenatally exposed infants  and an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn has been observed in several studies. Although several studies have not confirmed an increased risk for adverse neurodevelopment  a recent study observed an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders in prenatally exposed offspring.CONCLUSIONS: Causality cannot be confirmed in observational study settings. However  parallel results in individual studies regarding the cardiac malformations and pulmonary hypertension of the newborn  together with an existing biologically plausible mechanism behind these events may support causality. Considering the important role of serotonin in central nervous system development  more studies are needed to assess the possible adverse effects on long-term neurodevelopment."

The daytime sleepiness of narcolepsy is treated by a combination of planned daytime naps  regular exercise medications such as modafinil  or salts of methylphenidate  or amphetamine. Cataplexy that accompanies narcolepsy is treated with anticholinergic agents  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  or sodium oxybate. Children with neurodevelopmental disabilities such as autism have sleep initiation and maintenance difficulties on a multifactorial basis  with favorable response to melatonin in some patients. Childhood onset restless legs syndrome is often familial  associated with systemic iron deficiency  and responsive to iron supplementation and gabapentin. Parasomnias are episodic phenomena events which occur at the sleep -- wake transition or by intrusion on to sleep. Arousal parasomnias such as confusional arousals and sleep walking can sometimes be confused with seizures. A scheme for differentiating arousal parasomnias from nocturnal seizures is provided. Since arousal parasomnias are often triggered by sleep apnea  restless legs syndrome  or acid reflux  treatment measures directed specifically at these disorders often helps in resolution. Clonazepam provided in a low dose at bedtime can also alleviate sleep walking and confusional arousals. Obstructive sleep apnea affects about 2 percent of children. Adeno-tonsillar hypertrophy  cranio-facial anomalies  and obesity are common predisposing factors. Mild obstructive sleep apnea can be treated using a combination of nasal corticosteroids and a leukotriene antagonist. Moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea are treated with adeno-tonsillectomy  positive airway pressure breathing devices  or weight reduction as indicated. This paper provides an overview of the topic  with an emphasis on management steps. Where possible  the level of evidence for treatment recommendations is indicated."

The goal of this study was to systematically review evidence regarding medication treatments for individuals between the ages of 13 and 30 years with ASD.METHODS: The Medline  PsycINFO  and ERIC databases were searched (1980-December 2011)  as were reference lists of included articles. Two investigators independently assessed studies against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two investigators independently extracted data regarding participant and intervention characteristics  assessment techniques  and outcomes and assigned overall quality and strength of evidence ratings on the basis of predetermined criteria.RESULTS: Eight studies of medications were identified that focused on 13- to 30-year-olds with ASD; 4 of the studies were of fair quality. The strength of evidence was insufficient for all outcomes associated with medications tested in this population; however  the 2 available studies of the atypical antipsychotic medication risperidone in this age range were consistent with the moderate evidence in children with ASD for treating problem behavior  including aggression  and high strength of evidence for adverse events  including sedation and weight gain.CONCLUSIONS: There is a marked lack of data on use of medication treatments for adolescents and young adults with ASD. The evidence on the use of risperidone in this age range is insufficient when considered alone but is consistent with the data in the population of children with ASD."

Although the mechanistic basis for the disorder is not yet known  genetic analyses have suggested a role for abnormal excitatory/inhibitory signaling systems in brain  including dysregulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. In mice  the constitutive knockdown of NMDA receptors leads to social deficits  repetitive behavior  and self-injurious responses that reflect aspects of the autism clinical profile. However  social phenotypes differ with age: mice with reduced NMDA-receptor function exhibit hypersociability in adolescence  but markedly deficient sociability in adulthood. The present studies determined whether acute disruption of NMDA neurotransmission leads to exaggerated social approach  similar to that observed with constitutive disruption  in adolescent C57BL/6J mice. The effects of MK-801  an NMDA receptor antagonist  were compared with amphetamine  a dopamine agonist  and fluoxetine  a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  on performance in a three-chamber choice task. Results showed that acute treatment with MK-801 led to social approach deficits at doses without effects on entry numbers. Amphetamine also decreased social preference  but increased number of entries at every dose. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) had selective effects on social novelty preference. Withdrawal from a chronic ethanol regimen decreased activity  but did not attenuate sociability. Low doses of MK-801 and amphetamine were also evaluated in a marble-burying assay for repetitive behavior. MK-801  at a dose that did not disrupt sociability or alter entries  led to a profound reduction in marble-burying. Overall  these findings demonstrate that moderate alteration of NMDA  dopamine  or serotonin function can attenuate social preference in wild type mice."

Due to the limited amount of specific information obtained for some childhood disorders  the search was broadened to include relevant adult literature where information was extrapolated.RESULTS: Abundant literature was found on the nature of the ES and the executive dysfunctions in most psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents  but not so much on the use of medication. EF deficits were found to be more consistent in disorders such as ADHD  ASD and FASD than in the other disorders but were not specific enough for use as clinical markers for those disorders. For children with ADHD and ASD there was adequate information on the use of psychotropic medications and impact on some EF domains but information on the impact of medication on EF in the other disorders in children and adolescents was fairly limited. Medications acting on the dopaminergic system also showed positive effects on EF deficits and are commonly used in the treatment of EF disorders such as ADHD  ASD and FASD.CONCLUSION: Existing literature indicates that EF deficits underlie most psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. However  there are so many executive functions linked to so many activities and circuits in the brain that it is hard to quantify them in a particular disorder for use as specific markers for that disorder. The ES uses dopamine as its main neurotransmitter and this has implications for clinical management. Dopamine agonists (e.g. stimulants) and antagonists (e.g. neuroleptics) are medications that have direct impact on the ES and are commonly used to treat EF disorders in children and adolescents while serotonergic medications e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have not been very successful in treating such disorders. Identifying EF deficits early could be useful in guiding management including the use of medication in those disorders."

Altered SERT expression or regulation has been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders  including anxiety  depression and autism. Here  we implement a generalizable strategy that exploits antagonist-conjugated quantum dots (Qdots) to monitor  for the first time  single SERT proteins on the surface of serotonergic cells. We document two pools of SERT proteins defined by lateral mobility  one that exhibits relatively free diffusion  and a second  localized to cholesterol and GM1 ganglioside-enriched microdomains  that displays restricted mobility. Receptor-linked signaling pathways that enhance SERT activity mobilize transporters that  nonetheless  remain confined to membrane microdomains. Mobilization of transporters arises from a p38 MAPK-dependent untethering of the SERT C terminus from the juxtamembrane actin cytoskeleton. Our studies establish the utility of ligand-conjugated Qdots for analysis of the behavior of single membrane proteins and reveal a physical basis for signaling-mediated SERT regulation."

Identifying environmental triggers has been difficult due to poorly understood pathophysiology and subjective definitions of autism. The use of antidepressants by pregnant women has been associated with autism. These and other unmetabolized psychoactive pharmaceuticals (UPPs) have also been found in drinking water from surface sources  providing another possible exposure route and raising questions about human health consequences. Here  we examined gene expression patterns of fathead minnows treated with a mixture of three psychoactive pharmaceuticals (fluoxetine  venlafaxine &amp; carbamazepine) in dosages intended to be similar to the highest observed conservative estimates of environmental concentrations. We conducted microarray experiments examining brain tissue of fish exposed to individual pharmaceuticals and a mixture of all three. We used gene-class analysis to test for enrichment of gene sets involved with ten human neurological disorders. Only sets associated with idiopathic autism were unambiguously enriched. We found that UPPs induce autism-like gene expression patterns in fish. Our findings suggest a new potential trigger for idiopathic autism in genetically susceptible individuals involving an overlooked source of environmental contamination."
"103","22541665","Pharmacotherapy of autism spectrum disorders.","Although no pharmacological or behavioral therapy has currently proven effective for treating all core symptoms of autism  many dysfunctional behaviors may be treated pharmacologically. Drug treatments should always be part of a comprehensive management plan that includes behavioral and educational interventions  and should be focused on specific targets. Several classes of psychotropic medications have been used to decrease the wide range of &quot;maladaptive&quot; or &quot;interfering&quot; behaviors and associated medical problems that can interfere with relationships and physical health and hinder the implementation of various non-pharmacological interventions. Atypical neuroleptics have been shown to be useful in the treatment of behavioral symptoms in autism. Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder medications may be effective for counteracting the additional features of hyperactivity and short attention span. Antiepileptic drugs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have shown promising results  but there are no specific indications for them as of yet. With respect to potential drug targets  some clinical features are caused by a dysfunction in neurochemical signaling systems  and thus may improve with selective pharmacological interventions acting on specific abnormal neurobiological pathways. Recent animal studies can be useful models for understanding the common pathogenic pathways leading to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)  and have the potential to offer new biologically focused treatment options."

Our primary outcome was mean improvement in ratings scales of repetitive behavior. Publication bias was assessed by using a funnel plot  the Egger's test  and a meta-regression of sample size and effect size.RESULTS: Our search identified 5 published and 5 unpublished but completed trials eligible for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of 5 published and 1 unpublished trial (which provided data) demonstrated a small but significant effect of SRI for the treatment of repetitive behaviors in ASD (standardized mean difference: 0.22 [95% confidence interval: 0.07-0.37]  z score = 2.87  P &lt; .005). There was significant evidence of publication bias in all analyses. When Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill method was used to adjust for the effect of publication bias  there was no longer a significant benefit of SRI for the treatment of repetitive behaviors in ASD (standardized mean difference: 0.12 [95% confidence interval: -0.02 to 0.27]). Secondary analyses demonstrated no significant effect of type of medication  patient age  method of analysis  trial design  or trial duration on reported SRI efficacy.CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of the published literature suggests a small but significant effect of SRI in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in ASD. This effect may be attributable to selective publication of trial results. Without timely  transparent  and complete disclosure of trial results  it remains difficult to determine the efficacy of available medications."
"105","22494457","New directions in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders from animal model research.","INTRODUCTION: Currently  there is not an effective pharmacotherapy for the core symptoms of the autism spectrum disorders (ASD)  which include aberrant social behavior  delayed communication and repetitive behavior and/or restricted interests. There are several drugs that treat the symptoms associated with autism including irritability  aggressiveness and hyperactivity. Current drug research is based on the ongoing genetic  animal model and neuropathologic research. Two areas in particular  the glutamate and oxytocin systems  provide exciting new avenues for drug discovery.AREAS COVERED: This review examines what approaches have been used for the drugs that are currently being used to treat people with ASD. For the most part  drugs that treat other neuropsychiatric disorders have been examined to treat the people with ASD  unfortunately with little effect on the core symptoms.EXPERT OPINION: Until recently  there was not a plethora of knowledge about the neurobiological substrates of social behavior  pragmatic language usage and repetitive and/or restricted behaviors. Therefore  drug discovery has used the tools available for other neuropsychiatric disorders. Now that more biological information is available  there are many avenues for research for drug targets for ASD."
"106","22419332","Tricyclic antidepressants for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children and adolescents.","BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders  ranging in severity and characterised by early onset of delay and deviance in the development of social interaction  and verbal and nonverbal communication. ASD is associated with restricted and/or stereotyped interests or behaviours. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) block noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake  increasing the availability of these neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Via their impact on serotonin  TCAs have been used in the treatment of autistic symptoms and comorbidities in individuals with ASD.  OBJECTIVES: To determine if treatment with tricyclic antidepressants:1) improves the core features of autism  including restricted social interaction  restricted communication  and stereotypical and repetitive behaviours; 2) improves non-core features such as challenging behaviours; 3) improves comorbid states  such as depression and anxiety; 4) causes adverse effects.SEARCH METHODS: We ran the latest searches for this review on 23 May 2011. We searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)  2011 Issue 2  MEDLINE (1948 to May Week 2  2011)  EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 2)  PsycINFO (1887 to current)  CINAHL (1937 to current). We also searched Dissertation Abstracts International via Dissertation Express  and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of any dose  duration and frequency of oral TCAs compared with placebo  in children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ASD  where at least one standardised outcome measure had been used.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected and appraised the studies for inclusion and risk of bias. All data were continuous.MAIN RESULTS: Three studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Two studies used clomipramine and one used tianeptine. All three trials were small  with between 12 and 32 participants. One of the clomipramine trials involved children and young adults  while the other two trials enrolled only children. Due to heterogeneity in study participant characteristics  the TCA medications investigated and the outcome measures used  we were not able to perform any meta-analysis.In only one of the three studies was there any indication that giving children tianeptine could be effective in the short term. In this study  parents and teachers reported that it reduced irritability  hyperactivity  inadequate eye contact and inappropriate speech  but clinician ratings found no significant impact on these symptoms. There were also significant adverse effects  including increased drowsiness and reduced activity levels in these individuals while being treated with tianeptine. The evidence of the impact of clomipramine in the two studies is contradictory. There was evidence of improvement in autistic symptoms  irritability and obsessive-compulsive disorder type symptoms  but conflicting evidence in relation to hyperactivity across the two studies  and no significant changes found with inappropriate speech. There were also adverse effects reported with the use of clomipramine. Although side effect ratings were not significantly different to placebo  there were significant dropout rates in the clomipramine arm of one study.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians considering the use of TCAs need to be aware of the limited and conflicting evidence of effect and the side effect profile when discussing this treatment option with people who have ASD and their carers. Further research is required before TCAs can be recommended for treatment of individuals with ASD."

Thirty-seven were randomly assigned to fluoxetine (N=22) or placebo (N=15). Dosage followed a fixed schedule  starting at 10 mg/day and increasing as tolerated up to 80 mg/day. Repetitive behaviors were measured with the compulsion subscale of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale was used to rate improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms and overall severity.RESULTS: There was a significant treatment-by-time interaction indicating a significantly greater reduction in repetitive behaviors across time for fluoxetine than for placebo. With overall response defined as a CGI global improvement score of 2 or less  there were significantly more responders at week 12 in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo group. The risk ratio was 1.5 for CGI global improvement (responders: fluoxetine  35%; placebo  0%) and 1.8 for CGI-rated improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (responders: fluoxetine  50%; placebo  8%). Only mild and moderate side effects were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Fluoxetine treatment  compared to placebo  resulted in significantly greater improvement in repetitive behaviors  according to both the Yale-Brown compulsion subscale and CGI rating of obsessive-compulsive symptoms  as well as on the CGI overall improvement rating. Fluoxetine appeared to be well tolerated. These findings stand in contrast to findings in a trial of citalopram for childhood autism."

The response rate for SRI is approximately 50% and refractory OCD may exist. The effect of antipsychotics augmentation therapy has been established for this kind of patients. However  OCD is clinically and biologically heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disease and it will affect the response of pharmacotherapy. Several subtypes of OCD have been identified. Early onset OCD and hoarding symptoms dominant patients with OCD tend to resist SRI treatment. Antipsychotics augmentation with SRI is much effective for OCD with tic disorders. On the other hand  psychiatric disorders in obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders (OCSD) have similar clinical symptoms  comorbidities  genetic factors  and neurobiological etiology. SRI is effective for patients with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) in preoccupation with body appearance or sensation subgroup. The response of SRI in BDD is similar to OCD while that of eating disorders was different. Impulse control disorders will respond to opiate antagonist but not to SRI. This subgroup might have a characteristic of behavioral addiction. Antipsychotic agents are effective for neurological disorders including tic disorders  Tourette syndrome  and autistic spectrum disorders. Therefore  the dopaminergic pathophysiology might underlie in this subgroup. The main goal of DSM-V is to make diagnosis based on biological validity  and the treatment response is an important factor.

Recent evidence suggests that chronic SSRI exposure in adults increases serotonin (5-HT) levels in the raphe system and decreases norepinephrine (NE) locus ceruleus (LC) neural activity  suggesting a robust opposing interaction between these two monoamines. In contrast  perinatal SSRI exposure induces a long-lasting downregulation of the 5-HT-raphe system  which is opposite to that seen with chronic adult treatment. Therefore  the goal of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that perinatal CTM exposure (20 mg/kg/d) from postnatal day 1 (PN1) to PN10 leads to hyperexcited NE-LC circuit function in adult rats (&gt;PN90). Our single-neuron LC electrophysiological data demonstrated an increase in spontaneous and stimulus-driven neural activity  including an increase in phasic bursts in CTM-exposed animals. In addition  we demonstrated a corresponding immunoreactive increase in the rate-limiting catalyzing catecholamine enzyme (tyrosine hydroxylase) within the LC and their neocortical target sites compared to saline controls. Moreover  these effects were only evident in male exposed rats  suggesting a sexual dimorphism in neural development after SSRI exposure. Together  these results indicate that administration of SSRIs during a sensitive period of brain development results in long-lasting alterations in NE-LC circuit function in adults and may be useful in understanding the etiology of pervasive developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder."

It is unclear how perinatal exposure to drugs  such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  impacts cortical neural network function and what mechanism(s) may elicit the disruption of normal neuronal connections/interactions. In this article  we report on cortical wiring organization after pre- and postnatal exposure to the SSRI citalopram. We show that manipulation of 5-HT during early development in both in vitro and in vivo models disturbs characteristic chemoarchitectural and electrophysiological brain features  including changes in raphe and callosal connections  sensory processing  and myelin sheath formation. Also  drug-exposed rat pups exhibit neophobia and disrupted juvenile play behavior. These findings indicate that 5-HT homeostasis is required for proper brain maturation and that fetal/infant exposure to SSRIs should be examined in humans  particularly those with developmental dysfunction  such as autism."

The present study was undertaken to correlate striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding and cerebrospinal fluid insulin-like growth factor-1 (CSF-IGF-1) with clinical response in autistic children (n=13  age 5-16 years) after a 6-month fluoxetine treatment. Good clinical responders (n=6) had a decrease (p=0.031) in DAT binding as assessed using single-photon emission computed tomography with [123I]-nor-ß-CIT  whereas poor responders had a trend to an increase. An increase in CSF-IGF-1 (p=0.003) was detected after the treatment period  but no correlation between the clinical response and CSF-IGF-1 was found. In conclusion  fluoxetine decreases DAT binding indicating alleviation of the hyperdopaminergic state and increases CSF-IGF-1 concentration  which may also have a neuroprotective effect against dopamine-induced neurotoxicity in autistic children."

The data evaluating such practices are being reviewed.RECENT FINDINGS: There are accumulating data to suggest that atypical antipsychotics and stimulants may be useful for the treatment of irritability and hyperactivity in children and youth with ASD. The data for the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are less promising. New avenues of pharmacologic research targeting molecular targets identified by genomics  animal models and neuropathology are being evaluated. Areas of interest include glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid systems  neuropeptides such as oxytocin  and immune dysfunction  among others. In the case of biologically based CAM  a few compounds have been shown to be well tolerated  although efficacy is still being evaluated  such as melatonin  certain vitamins  and omega 3 fatty acids.

All participants were administered the Penn Emotion Recognition Test (ER40) and were genotyped for 5HTTLPR.RESULTS: Our study showed that parents of children with autism performed worse in the facial emotion recognition test than controls. Analyses of error patterns showed that parents of children with autism over-attributed neutral to emotional faces. We found evidence that 5HTTLPR polymorphism did not influence the performance in the Penn Emotion Recognition Test  but that it may determine different error patterns.CONCLUSION: Facial emotion recognition deficits are more common in first-degree relatives of autistic patients than in the general population  suggesting that facial emotion recognition is a candidate endophenotype for autism."

Use of antidepressant medications during pregnancy also shows a secular increase in recent decades  prompting concerns that prenatal exposure may contribute to increased risk of ASD.OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate whether prenatal exposure to antidepressant medications is associated with increased risk of ASD.DESIGN: Population-based case-control study. Medical records were used to ascertain case children and control children and to derive prospectively recorded information on mothers' use of antidepressant medications  mental health history of mothers  and demographic and medical covariates.SETTING: The Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Northern California.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 298 case children with ASD (and their mothers) and 1507 randomly selected control children (and their mothers) drawn from the membership of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Northern California.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ASDs.RESULTS: Prenatal exposure to antidepressant medications was reported for 20 case children (6.7%) and 50 control children (3.3%). In adjusted logistic regression models  we found a 2-fold increased risk of ASD associated with treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors by the mother during the year before delivery (adjusted odds ratio  2.2 [95% confidence interval  1.2-4.3])  with the strongest effect associated with treatment during the first trimester (adjusted odds ratio  3.8 [95% confidence interval  1.8-7.8]). No increase in risk was found for mothers with a history of mental health treatment in the absence of prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.CONCLUSION: Although the number of children exposed prenatally to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in this population was low  results suggest that exposure  especially during the first trimester  may modestly increase the risk of ASD. The potential risk associated with exposure must be balanced with the risk to the mother or fetus of untreated mental health disorders. Further studies are needed to replicate and extend these findings."

Especially maladaptive behaviours like increased irritability  aggression  impulsivity and self-injurious behaviours are perceived as enormously stressful and can interfere with interventions targeting social and communication deficits. Medication treatments focussing on troubling comorbid problems in ASD can be fundamentally ameliorative  although core features of the disorder itself cannot be sufficiently treated. While atypical antipsychotics and stimulant medication have been proven to be effective in large multisite networks of ASD  serotonin reuptake inhibitors are of limited efficacy. Novel pharmacotherapies to improve social impairment are in the early stages of research."

Many medical treatments for ASDs have been proposed and studied  but there is currently no consensus regarding which interventions are most effective.OBJECTIVE: To systematically review evidence regarding medical treatments for children aged 12 years and younger with ASDs.METHODS: We searched the Medline  PsycInfo  and ERIC (Education Resources Information Center) databases from 2000 to May 2010  regulatory data for approved medications  and reference lists of included articles. Two reviewers independently assessed each study against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Studies of secretin were not included in this review. Two reviewers independently extracted data regarding participant and intervention characteristics  assessment techniques  and outcomes and assigned overall quality and strength-of-evidence ratings on the basis of predetermined criteria.RESULTS: Evidence supports the benefit of risperidone and aripiprazole for challenging and repetitive behaviors in children with ASDs. Evidence also supports significant adverse effects of these medications. Insufficient strength of evidence is present to evaluate the benefits or adverse effects for any other medical treatments for ASDs  including serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and stimulant medications.CONCLUSIONS: Although many children with ASDs are currently treated with medical interventions  strikingly little evidence exists to support benefit for most treatments. Risperidone and aripiprazole have shown benefit for challenging and repetitive behaviors  but associated adverse effects limit their use to patients with severe impairment or risk of injury."
"125","21443820","Brain illness and creativity: mechanisms and treatment risks.","Brain diseases and their treatment may help or hurt creativity in ways that shape quality of life. Increased creative drive is associated with bipolar disorder  depression  psychosis  temporal lobe epilepsy  frontotemporal dementia  Parkinson disease treatments  and autism. Creativity depends on goal-driven approach motivation from midbrain dopaminergic systems. Fear-driven avoidance motivation is of less aid to creativity. When serotonin and norepinephrine lower motivation and flexible behaviour  they can inhibit creativity. Hemispheric lateralization and frontotemporal connections must interact to create new ideas and conceptual schemes. The right brain and temporal lobe contribute skill in novelty detection  while the left brain and frontal lobe foster approach motivation and more easily generate new patterns of action from the novel perceptions. Genes and phenotypes that increase plasticity and creativity in tolerant environments with relaxed selection pressure may confer risk in rigorous environments. Few papers substantively address this important but fraught topic. Antidepressants (ADs) that inhibit fear-driven motivation  such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  sometimes inhibit goal-oriented motivation as well. ADs that boost goal-directed motivation  such as bupropion  may remediate this effect. Benzodiazepines and alcohol may be counterproductive. Although dopaminergic agonists sometimes stimulate creativity  their doing so may inappropriately disinhibit behaviour. Dopamine antagonists may suppress creative motivation; lithium and anticonvulsant mood stabilizers may do so less. Physical exercise and REM sleep may help creativity. Art therapy and psychotherapy are not well studied. Preserving creative motivation can help creativity and other aspects of well-being in all patients  not just artists or researchers."

However  approximately 30% of patients do not respond sufficiently to first-line antidepressant drug treatment and require alternative therapeutics. Genome-wide studies searching for SSRI response DNA biomarkers or studies of candidate serotonin-related genes so far have given inconclusive or contradictory results. Here  we present an alternative transcriptome-based genome-wide approach for searching antidepressant drug-response biomarkers by using drug-effect phenotypes in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs).MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: We screened 80 LCLs from healthy adult female individuals for growth inhibition by paroxetine. A total of 14 LCLs with reproducible high and low sensitivities to paroxetine (seven from each phenotypic group) were chosen for genome-wide expression profiling with commercial microarrays.RESULTS: The most notable genome-wide transcriptome difference between LCLs displaying high versus low paroxetine sensitivities was a 6.3-fold lower (p = 0.0000256) basal expression of CHL1  a gene coding for a neuronal cell adhesion protein implicated in correct thalamocortical circuitry  schizophrenia and autism. The microarray findings were confirmed by real-time PCR (36-fold lower CHL1 expression levels in the high paroxetine sensitivity group). Several additional genes implicated in synaptogenesis or in psychiatric disorders  including ARRB1  CCL5  DDX60  DDX60L  ENDOD1  ENPP2  FLT1  GABRA4  GAP43  MCTP2 and SPRY2  also differed by more than 1.5-fold and a p-value of less than 0.005 between the two paroxetine sensitivity groups  as confirmed by real-time PCR experiments.CONCLUSION: Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of in vitro phenotyped LCLs identified CHL1 and additional genes implicated in synaptogenesis and brain circuitry as putative SSRI response biomarkers. This method might be used as a preliminary tool for searching for potential depression treatment biomarkers."

In some individuals serotonin reuptake inhibitors  which decrease pre-synaptic re-uptake of serotonin  can ameliorate symptoms  as can resperidone  which blocks both dopamine and serotonin receptors. Loss of maternal UBE3A expression causes AS  while maternal duplications of chromosome 15q11.2-q13 that include the UBE3A gene cause ASD  implicating the maternally expressed UBE3A gene in the ASD phenotype. In a Drosophila screen for proteins regulated by UBE3A  we identified a key regulator of monoamine synthesis  the gene Punch  or GCH1  encoding the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase I. Here we show that Dube3a  the fly UBE3A orthologue  regulates Punch/GCH1 in the fly brain. Over-expression of Dube3a elevates tetrahydrobiopterin (THB)  the rate-limiting cofactor in monoamine synthesis while loss of Dube3a has the opposite effect. The fluctuations in dopamine levels were associated with hyper- and hypoactivity  respectively  in flies. We show that changes in Punch/GCH1 and dopamine levels do not depend on the ubiquitin ligase catalytic domain of Dube3a. In addition  both wild type Dube3a and a ubiquitination-defective Dube3a-C/A form were found at high levels in nuclear fractions and appear to be poly-ubiquitinated in vivo by endogenous Dube3a. We propose that the transcriptional co-activation function of Dube3a may regulate GCH1 activity in the brain. These results provide a connection between monoamine synthesis (dopamine/serotonin) and Dube3a expression that may explain why some individuals with ASD or AS respond better to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors than others."

Altered regulation of central serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission may underlie such behavioral deficits. To test this  we compared 5-HT transporter (SERT)  5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptor densities among BTBR and C57 strains. Autoradiographic [(3) H] cyanoimipramine (1 nM) binding to SERT was 20-30% lower throughout the adult BTBR brain as compared to C57BL/10J mice. In hippocampal membrane homogenates  [(3) H] citalopram maximal binding (B(max) ) to SERT was 95 ± 13 fmol/mg protein in BTBR and 171 ± 20 fmol/mg protein in C57BL/6J mice  and the BTBR dissociation constant (K(D) ) was 2.0 ± 0.3 nM versus 1.1 ± 0.2 in C57BL/6J mice. Hippocampal 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptor binding was similar among strains. However  8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [(35) S] GTP<U+03B3>S binding in the BTBR hippocampal CA(1) region was 28% higher  indicating elevated 5-HT(1A) capacity to activate G-proteins. In BTBR mice  the SERT blocker  fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) and the 5-HT(1A) receptor partial-agonist  buspirone (2 mg/kg) enhanced social interactions. The D(2) /5-HT(2) receptor antagonist  risperidone (0.1 mg/kg) reduced marble burying  but failed to improve sociability.

Here  we report the case of a 15-year-old boy with pervasive developmental disorder who developed catatonia. At admission  catatonic symptoms were severe and the patient required a feeding tube. Lorazepam up to 15 mg/day moderately improved the catatonic symptoms. On day 36 we added fluoxetine and on day 62 we added packing therapy (twice per week  10 sessions). After three packing sessions  the patient showed a significant clinical improvement (P&lt;0.001). At discharge (day 96)  he was able to return to his special education program. Although we do not consider packing as a psychodynamic treatment  this case challenges the concept of embodied self that has opened new perspectives on a dialogue between psychoanalysis and neuroscience. Indeed  better body representation following packing sessions  as shown in patient's drawing  paralleled clinical improvement  and supports the concept of embodied self. This concept may serve as a link between psychoanalysis and attachment theory  developmental psychology with the early description of &quot;sense of self&quot;  and cognitive neurosciences that more and more support the concept of embodied cognition.

Trials must have included at least one standardised outcome measure.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and risk of bias. All data were continuous. Meta-analysis  where possible  used a random-effects model.MAIN RESULTS: Seven RCTs with a total of 271 participants were included. Four SSRIs were evaluated: fluoxetine (two studies)  fluvoxamine (two studies)  fenfluramine (two studies) and citalopram (one study). Five studies included only children and two studies included only adults. Varying inclusion criteria were used with regard to diagnostic criteria and intelligence of participants. Seventeen different outcome measures were reported. Although more than one study reported data for Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and obsessive-compulsive behaviour (OCB)  different tool types or components of these outcomes were used in each study. As such  data were unsuitable for meta-analysis. One large  high quality study in children showed no evidence of positive effect of citalopram. Two small studies in adults showed positive outcomes for CGI and OCB; one study showed improvements in aggression and another in anxiety.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of effect of SSRIs in children and emerging evidence of harm. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of SSRIs in adults from small studies in which risk of bias is unclear."

The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has a positive effect on treating some symptoms of autism. The effects of these drugs vary in individuals because of the presence of the S or L allele of 5-HTTLPR. Studies performed on various autistic populations have found different allele frequencies for the L and S alleles. Allele frequencies and genotypes of the South African autistic populations (African  mixed  and Caucasian) were compared with matching South African ethnic control populations. The *S/*S genotype was found to be highly significantly associated with all the South African autistic ethnic populations. In the South African African population the *S/*S genotype was present in 7 (33%) of the autistic individuals but in none of the control subjects  yielding infinitely large odds of developing autism. The odds of developing autism with the *S/*S genotype compared to the *L/*L genotype increased 10.15-fold in the South African mixed group and 2.74-fold in the South African Caucasian population. The allele frequency of the South African autistic population was also compared with studies of other autistic populations around the world  and highly significant differences were found with the Japanese  Korean  and Indian population groups. The difference was not significant for the French  German  Israeli  Portuguese  and American groups. This is the first South African study of autistic individuals of different ethnic backgrounds that shows significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies of 5-HTTLPR. The results of this study open new avenues for investigating the role of transmission of the L and S alleles in families with autism in South Africa."

Thirty-three studies addressed the association between genes particularly dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) and dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) and response to medication for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Only two studies investigated atomoxetine as the pharmacological intervention  and the other 31 studies investigated methylphenidate (MPH). One study assessed children with depression and anxiety disorders and another assessed children with autism; in both of them selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were the pharmacological intervention.CONCLUSION: The existing literature on the pharmacogenetics of ADHD suggests that response to MPH is influenced by several different polymorphisms  each one exerting a small effect. Genome-wide association studies and multi-center collaborative projects are likely to overcome the barriers for the development of the field  mainly if a priori conceptual hypothesis and rigorous methodological strategies are followed. Future investigations should evaluate  besides improvement of symptoms  emergence of clinically relevant side effects. The lessons we have learned from the progress of the pharmacogenetics of ADHD can be relevant for developing pharmacogenetic studies in other child and adolescent psychiatric disorders."

Among the potential environmental factors  hyperserotonemia during pregnancy and its effect on brain development could be playing a role in this prevalence raise. In the rodent model developed by Whitaker-Azmitia and colleagues  hyperserotonemia during fetal development results in a dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis  affecting the amygdala as well as pro-social hormone oxytocin regulation. Dysfunction of the amygdala and abnormal oxytocin levels may underlie many clinical features of ASD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the most widely used class of antidepressants drugs  and they are not contraindicated during pregnancy. In this paper  we hypothesize that increased serotonemia during pregnancy  including due to SSRI intake  could be one of the causes of the raising prevalence in autism. If our hypothesis is confirmed  it will not only shed light on one of the possible reason for autism prevalence  but also offer new preventive and treatment options."

Several of these drugs  including imipramine  citalopram  sertraline  and fluoxetine (Prozac)  bound more avidly to SERT in the presence of Cl(-). In contrast  Cl(-) did not enhance cocaine or paroxetine binding. A Cl(-) binding site recently identified in SERT  and shown to be important for Cl(-) dependent transport  was also critical for the Cl(-) dependence of antidepressant affinity. Mutation of the residues contributing to this site eliminated the Cl(-)-mediated affinity increase for imipramine and fluoxetine. Analysis of ligand docking to a single state of SERT indicated only small differences in the energy of interaction between bound ligands and Cl(-). These differences in interaction energy cannot account for the affinity differences observed for Cl(-) dependence. However  fluoxetine binding led to a conformational change  detected by cysteine accessibility experiments  that was qualitatively different from that induced by cocaine or other ligands. Given the known Cl(-) requirement for serotonin-induced conformational changes  we propose that Cl(-) binding facilitates conformational changes required for optimal binding of fluoxetine and other antidepressant drugs."

Participants had autistic spectrum disorders  Asperger disorder  or pervasive developmental disorder  not otherwise specified; had illness severity ratings of at least moderate on the Clinical Global Impressions  Severity of Illness Scale; and scored at least moderate on compulsive behaviors measured with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders.INTERVENTIONS: Twelve weeks of citalopram hydrobromide (10 mg/5 mL) or placebo. The mean (SD) maximum dosage of citalopram hydrobromide was 16.5 (6.5) mg/d by mouth (maximum  20 mg/d).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Positive response was defined by a score of much improved or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impressions  Improvement subscale. An important secondary outcome was the score on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders. Adverse events were systematically elicited using the Safety Monitoring Uniform Report Form.RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the rate of positive response on the Clinical Global Impressions  Improvement subscale between the citalopram-treated group (32.9%) and the placebo group (34.2%) (relative risk  0.96; 95% confidence interval  0.61-1.51; P &gt; .99). There was no difference in score reduction on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders from baseline (mean [SD]  -2.0 [3.4] points for the citalopram-treated group and -1.9 [2.5] points for the placebo group; P = .81). Citalopram use was significantly more likely to be associated with adverse events  particularly increased energy level  impulsiveness  decreased concentration  hyperactivity  stereotypy  diarrhea  insomnia  and dry skin or pruritus.CONCLUSION: Results of this trial do not support the use of citalopram for the treatment of repetitive behavior in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders.

These behavioral abnormalities in rodents may be related to the symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders  such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder  obsessive-compulsive disorder  autism  schizophrenia and depression. In this study  we examined the effect of long-term SI rearing after weaning on emotional behaviors and cognitive function in mice. Furthermore  the effects of methylphenidate (MPH)  clozapine (CLZ) and fluoxetine (FLX) on SI-induced behavioral changes were examined to measure the predictive validity of SI-reared mice as an animal model for these neuropsychiatric disorders. MPH improved SI-induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated-plus maze test  but had no effect on aggressive behavior. In contrast  CLZ ameliorated aggressive behavior  but not anxiety-like behavior in SI-reared mice. Repeated FLX treatment prevented SI-induced aggressive behavior and social interaction deficits. These findings suggest that SI-induced behavioral abnormality is a psychobehavioral complex relevant to various clinical symptoms observed in neuropsychiatric disorders and that SI-reared mice are a useful animal model to study the pathophysiology/pathogenesis of these diseases."

Meta analyses  randomized clinical trials  and other prospective experimental studies of pharmacotherapy conducted in the United States in the past 10 years in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years were reviewed. The results support moderate success in treating the associated behaviors of autism and minimal success in treating core deficits across all drug classes. Preliminary evidence demonstrates possible uses for atypical antipsychotic agents  selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors  stimulants  and N-methyl-D-aspirate receptor antagonists in decreasing the core behaviors and associated symptoms of autism.

After a washout period from previous medications (2-14 days)  patients received olanzapine (5-10 mg/day) for a 13-week treatment period. The primary efficacy measures were Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) done at baseline and end of treatment. At the beginning and end of treatment  patients underwent laboratory and physical investigations: ECG  chest X-ray  urinalysis  serum chemistry  blood glucose and lipid profile  hematology and hepatitis B serology.RESULTS: Paired comparison of baseline and 13-week endpoint scores showed significant reductions in ABC subscale scores for irritability (p &lt; 0.0001)  lethargy (p &lt; 0.0001)  stereotyped behavior (p &lt; 0.005)  hyperactivity (p &lt; 0.0001) and inappropriate speech (p &lt; 0.005).

No liver enzyme elevation or any other serum biochemical changes resulted from treatment  which was not associated with significant body weight changes or any other treatment-emergent side effects.CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that olanzapine treatment can be beneficial in alleviating some behavioral symptoms (irritability  hyperactivity/noncompliance and lethargy/withdrawal) associated with autism. The short period of this trial limits inferences about adverse effects such as body weight increase and tardive dyskinesia. Further long-term placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine are required."

Currently  evidence for psychotropic use and awareness of adverse effects in young people with autism is limited.

Although increased appetite  weight gain  and sedation are among the most common side effects  risperidone-induced enuresis is rarely reported.METHOD: We will present two cases with risperidone-induced enuresis  and discuss our findings in the context of current literature.RESULTS: Two children aged 11 and 10 years  diagnosed with autism and mental retardation  have developed new-onset diurnal and nocturnal enuresis respectively on their first and second weeks of risperidone monotherapy (1.5 and 1 mg/day). They did not experience sedation  and their medical history and workup were unremarkable. As enuresis did not resolve spontaneously  we decided to substitute risperidone with olanzapine. Enuresis ceased rapidly after discontinuation of risperidone with no emergence when patients were treated with olanzapine 5 mg/day for a period of 6 months and 1 year  respectively.DISCUSSION: Although the pathophysiology of antipsychotic-induced enuresis remains unclear  a number of mechanisms including alpha(1)-adrenergic blockade  dopamine blockade  and antimuscarinic effects has been proposed. Olanzapine has lower alpha(1)-adrenergic and dopaminergic blockade properties  thus changing risperidone to olanzapine may be an alternative modality in risperidone-induced enuresis when antipsychotic treatment is crucial. Clinicians should be more vigilant about screening for this side effect  especially in younger population with developmental disabilities."
"168","17687333","Antidepressant binding site in a bacterial homologue of neurotransmitter transporters.","Sodium-coupled transporters are ubiquitous pumps that harness pre-existing sodium gradients to catalyse the thermodynamically unfavourable uptake of essential nutrients  neurotransmitters and inorganic ions across the lipid bilayer. Dysfunction of these integral membrane proteins has been implicated in glucose/galactose malabsorption  congenital hypothyroidism  Bartter's syndrome  epilepsy  depression  autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sodium-coupled transporters are blocked by a number of therapeutically important compounds  including diuretics  anticonvulsants and antidepressants  many of which have also become indispensable tools in biochemical experiments designed to probe antagonist binding sites and to elucidate transport mechanisms. Steady-state kinetic data have revealed that both competitive and noncompetitive modes of inhibition exist. Antagonist dissociation experiments on the serotonin transporter (SERT) have also unveiled the existence of a low-affinity allosteric site that slows the dissociation of inhibitors from a separate high-affinity site. Despite these strides  atomic-level insights into inhibitor action have remained elusive. Here we screen a panel of molecules for their ability to inhibit LeuT  a prokaryotic homologue of mammalian neurotransmitter sodium symporters  and show that the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) clomipramine noncompetitively inhibits substrate uptake. Cocrystal structures show that clomipramine  along with two other TCAs  binds in an extracellular-facing vestibule about 11 A above the substrate and two sodium ions  apparently stabilizing the extracellular gate in a closed conformation. Off-rate assays establish that clomipramine reduces the rate at which leucine dissociates from LeuT and reinforce our contention that this TCA inhibits LeuT by slowing substrate release. Our results represent a molecular view into noncompetitive inhibition of a sodium-coupled transporter and define principles for the rational design of new inhibitors."

In pharmacogenetic terms  there are some isolated studies on associations between serotonergic mechanisms and pharmacotherapy. For the area of autism  such studies are still lacking.CONCLUSIONS: The presented serotonergic mechanisms show relationships of this polymorphism to ADHD and autistic disorders  but they do not result in a uniform picture. The overlaps can best be explained by a dimensional classification approach. As yet  only a small number of studies on attentional disorders in autism and ADHD using shared samples have been carried out.

In this context  we present a rationale for utilizing pharmacologic treatments aimed at modifying key neurodevelopmental processes in young children with autism. Early treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is presented as a model for pharmacologic interventions because there is evidence in autistic children for reduced brain serotonin synthesis during periods of peak synaptogenesis; serotonin is known to enhance synapse refinement; and exploratory studies with these agents in autistic children exist.

In families with individuals with autism  several reports of biased transmission of both alleles (short  long) at the serotonin transporter gene promotor polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) locus of SLC6A4 now exist. The heterogeneity in these reports may be due to clinical heterogeneity. The authors hypothesized that 5-HTTLPR genotypes would be related to variation in specific symptoms in children with autism.METHOD: The authors explored whether variants of two functional polymorphisms of SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR  intron 2 variable number tandem repeat [2 VNTR]) were related to behavioral characteristics measured by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Subjects (N=73  age 3-19 years old) met diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder based on both measures.RESULTS: Evidence of genotype-phenotype interactions on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised was found with the 5-HTTLPR short group of HTTLPR (S/L or S/S genotypes) being rated as more severe on the subdomain &quot;failure to use nonverbal communication to regulate social interaction &quot; and the long group (L/L genotype) being more severe on the subdomain &quot;stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms&quot; and on an aggression measure. In contrast  on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule  the long group was associated with greater severity on directed facial expressions and unusual sensory interests. There were no significant relationships between the intron 2 VNTR genotypes and subdomains or domains of symptoms on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule.CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide initial support for genotype-specific phenotypes for 5-HTTLPR in autism based on ratings from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule."

Given the dearth of reliable interventions  there is great interest in demonstrating efficacy of the various treatment options. A growing body of evidence links autism spectrum disorders to abnormalities in serotonin function  and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been utilized to target various symptoms of the disorders. This article reviews the available data on the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. Objectives for future research in this area will also be suggested.DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: The entire PubMed database including MEDLINE (1966-July 2005) was searched for English-language biomedical articles. Search terms included autism  autism spectrum disorder  citalopram  escitalopram  fluoxetine  fluvoxamine  paroxetine  pervasive developmental disorder  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  and sertraline. All clinical trials evaluating treatment outcomes associated with the use of SSRIs in managing symptoms of autism that were identified in the search were reviewed. All randomized controlled trials and open-label trials were included in this review. Case reports and case series were excluded.DATA SYNTHESIS: We identified 3 randomized controlled trials and 10 open-label trials or retrospective chart reviews on the use of SSRIs in autism and autism spectrum disorders. The SSRIs that have been studied in autism spectrum disorders are citalopram  escitalopram  fluoxetine  fluvoxamine  and sertraline. Most studies demonstrate significant improvement in global functioning and in symptoms associated with anxiety and repetitive behaviors. While side effects were generally considered to be mild  increased activation and agitation occurred in some subjects.CONCLUSIONS: Although SSRIs may demonstrate therapeutic benefit in autism spectrum disorders  methodological weaknesses of many of the clinical trials suggest the need for additional randomized controlled trials. Furthermore  given the increased awareness of the dangers associated with SSRI-induced activation and agitation  the presence of these side effects in the autistic population warrants closer attention to dosage  titration  and subject selection issues."

Specific variants of the 5-HTT gene  SLC6A4  especially the insertion-deletion 5-HTTLPR promoter locus  have been found to modulate its expression and transporter function.METHODS: We examined the transmission of the short or long allele of 5-HTTLPR locus to affected individuals  using a large cohort of 352 families. In addition  we screened five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5' region of SLC6A4 previously reported to be positively associated with autism  as well as 4 additional SNPs also in the 5' region.RESULTS: No association of the 5-HTTLPR locus with autism was found. Furthermore  no evidence for association of any of the nine SNPs covering the SLC6A4 gene  or any of their haplotypes  was observed in our study.

Despite these positive reports  there continues to be questions about the tolerability and appropriate dosing of SSRIs in children with PDDs. Because of the limited number of placebo-controlled studies  definitive conclusions about the role SSRIs should play in the clinical treatment of children with PDDs cannot be drawn. Larger  placebo-controlled studies of SSRIs are needed to guide clinical treatment."

Although it is to expected that in the future it will become possible to treat intellectual disability itself by pharmacological means  at present we can only act on the behavioural and neurological syndromes that accompany MR.DEVELOPMENT AND CONCLUSIONS: This review looks at the different pharmacological agents that may improve the problems that usually make it more difficult for a patient with MR to adapt within the family  at school and in the workplace. The neuropsychiatric disorders that most often require pharmacological treatment include attention deficit  hyperactivity  behavioural disorders  autism  anxiety  aggressiveness  self-injury and affective disorders. The most frequently used drugs are stimulants  atypical antipsychotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Their characteristics and application in the different situations that require medical attention are described. The pharmacological treatment of certain common genetic syndromes that involve MR and which are highly specific in their behavioural expression are also discussed."

"186","16268664","Advances in drug treatments for children and adolescents with autism and other pervasive developmental disorders.","Autism is a disorder characterised by abnormalities in language and social development  and repetitive behaviours. Antipsychotics  including haloperidol and risperidone  are the most widely studied drugs for reducing symptoms in children and adolescents with autism. When administered at relatively low dosages  antipsychotics have been shown to reduce repetitive behaviours (stereotypies) and social withdrawal  as well as a number of related symptoms  such as hyperactivity  aggression  self-abusive behaviour  temper tantrums  lability of mood and irritability. Adverse effects of antipsychotics include sedation  dizziness  increased appetite  weight gain  changes in the electrocardiogram parameters  drooling  hyperprolactinemia and a risk of drug-related dyskinesias. Other agents have been less well studied for the treatment of autism  but there are suggestive data regarding their safety and efficacy. Of these agents  a number have been investigated  based on theories about the aetiology of autism  including SSRIs and naltrexone  although the efficacy of these agents has been limited. Stimulant drugs have been shown to reduce hyperactivity and improve focus  but they may cause behavioural worsening  weight loss and stereotypies de novo. Secretin is a treatment that has received much media attention after reports of efficacy from small open studies  but all controlled studies have failed to show any benefit. In autism  alternative treatments have also been used  but none have shown benefit in well-designed studies."

Eighteen children with autistic disorder completed a 12-week double-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized crossover study of fluvoxamine. Behavioral assessments were obtained before and at 12 weeks of treatment. 5-HTTLPR (long (l) or short(s))  was analyzed by the PCR method. Ten out of 18 patients responded to fluvoxamine treatment; allele type analysis revealed that clinical global effectiveness was noted significantly more in the l allele than in the s allele. However  with respect to language use  a significant effectiveness was noted in the s allele. 5-HTTLPR may influence the individual responses to fluvoxamine administration."
"188","16103890","Autism and the serotonin transporter: the long and short of it.","Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder manifesting early in childhood. Some symptoms of autism are alleviated by treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  which are known to interact with the serotonin transporter. Moreover  variation in the gene that encodes the transporter (SLC6A4)  especially the HTTLPR locus  is known to modulate its expression. It is natural  therefore  to evaluate whether this variation plays a role in liability to autism. We investigated the impact of alleles at HTTLPR and three other loci in SLC6A4 by using a large  independent family-based sample (390 families  1528 individuals) from the NIH Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism (CPEA) network. Allele transmissions to individuals diagnosed with autism were biased only for HTTLPR  both for the narrow diagnosis of autism (P=0.035) and for the broader diagnosis of autism spectrum (P=0.007). The short allele of HTTLPR was significantly overtransmitted. Investigation of haplotype transmissions suggested that  in our data  biased transmission was only due to HTTLPR. With respect to this locus  there are now seven of 12 studies reporting significant transmission bias of HTTLPR alleles  a noteworthy result in itself. However  the studies with significant findings are almost equally divided between overtransmission of short and overtransmission of long alleles. We place our results within this extremely heterogeneous field of studies. Determining the factors influencing the relationship between autism phenotypes and HTTLPR variation  as well as other loci in SLC6A4  could be an important advance in our understanding of this complex disorder."

"190","15995945","Allelic heterogeneity at the serotonin transporter locus (SLC6A4) confers susceptibility to autism and rigid-compulsive behaviors.","Autism is a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders with a primarily genetic etiology exhibiting deficits in (1) development of language and (2) social relationships and (3) patterns of repetitive  restricted behaviors or interests and resistance to change. Elevated platelet serotonin (5-HT) in 20%-25% of cases and efficacy of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating anxiety  depression  and repetitive behaviors points to the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT; SERT) as a strong candidate gene. Association studies involving the functional insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter (5-HTTLPR) and a polymorphism in intron 2 are inconclusive  possibly because of phenotypic heterogeneity. Nonetheless  mounting evidence for genetic linkage of autism to the chromosome 17q11.2 region that harbors the SERT locus (SLC6A4) supports a genetic effect at or near this gene. We confirm recent reports of sex-biased genetic effects in 17q by showing highly significant linkage driven by families with only affected males. Association with common alleles fails to explain observed linkage; therefore  we hypothesized that preferential transmission of multiple alleles does explain it. From 120 families  most contributing to linkage at 17q11.2  we found four coding substitutions at highly conserved positions and 15 other variants in 5' noncoding and other intronic regions transmitted in families exhibiting increased rigid-compulsive behaviors. In the aggregate  these variants show significant linkage to and association with autism. Our data provide strong support for a collection of multiple  often rare  alleles at SLC6A4 as imposing risk of autism."
"191","15934872","Emerging drugs in Tourette syndrome.","Proper education of the patient is the first step in the treatment of Tourette syndrome (TS). Before deciding how to treat the patient  it is important to decide whether to treat the TS-related symptoms. Counselling and behavioural modification may be sufficient for those with mild symptoms. Medications  however  may be considered when symptoms begin to interfere with peer relationships  social interactions  academic or job performance  or with activities of daily living. Therapy must be individualised and the most troublesome symptoms should be targeted first. Antidopaminergic agents are clearly the most effective drugs in the treatment of tics. Although haloperidol and pimozide are the only drugs currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of TS  other dopamine receptor-blocking drugs and tetrabenazine  a dopamine depleting drug  as well as botulinum toxin injections  have been used to treat tics associated with TS. Carefully designed  comparative  longitudinal trials assessing the efficacy and adverse-effect profiles of these drugs  including tardive dyskinesia  are lacking. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are recommended for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive behaviour: a common comorbidity. Psychostimulants  such as methylphenidate  are the treatment of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Even though these drugs may transiently increase tics  this does not necessarily constitute a definite contraindication to the use of these drugs in patients with TS. Here  existing and emerging medical treatments in patients with tics and comorbid behavioural disorders associated with TS are reviewed."
"192","15882779","Lack of evidence for association between the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) polymorphisms and autism in the Chinese trios.","Serotonin regulates several aspects of brain development  and it is involved in a range of behaviors frequently disturbed in autistic disorder. The serotonin transporter is a critical component of the serotonergic system. The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is of special interest given the nature of the biological findings and the reported effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors of autistic symptoms. So far the genetics researches of the SLC6A4 gene have given conflicting results. The aim of study was to investigate the association between the SLC6A4 gene and autism in the Chinese Han population. The present study was conducted with the detection of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP(S)) located within the SLC6A4 gene by using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) analysis. We performed a family-based association study of these polymorphisms in 175 Chinese Han family trios. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) measurement (D') analysis showed the presence of LD between markers across the locus. No significant evidence of association was found at any of the markers detected by using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and haplotype analyses in all samples and male samples. Our findings suggest that it is unlikely that DNA variations in the SLC6A4 gene play a significant role in the genetic predisposition to autism in the Chinese Han population or that allelic heterogeneity at the SLC6A4 loci dilutes potential disease-allele association."
"193","15854594","Quantitative analysis of immunolabeling for serotonin and for glutamate transporters after administration of imipramine and citalopram.","Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine  5-HT) is an amine neurotransmitter derived from tryptophan and is important in brain systems regulating mood  emotional behavior  and sleep. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs are used to treat disorders such as depression  stress  eating disorders  autism  and schizophrenia. It is thought that these drugs act to prolong the action of 5-HT by blocking reuptake. This may lead to decreased 5-HT content in the nerve fibers themselves; however  this has not previously been directly demonstrated. We have studied the effects of administration of two drugs  imipramine and citalopram  on levels of 5-HT in nerve fibers in the murine brain. Quantitative analysis of the areal density of 5-HT fibers throughout the brain was performed using ImageJ software. While a high density of fibers was observed in mid- and hind-brain regions and areas such as thalamus and hypothalamus  densities were far lower in areas such as cortex  where SSRIs might be thought to exert their actions. As anticipated  imipramine and citalopram produced a decline in 5-HT levels in nerve fibers  but the result was not uniform. Areas such as inferior colliculus showed significant reduction whereas little  if any  change was observed in the adjacent superior colliculus. The reason for  and significance of  this regionality is unclear. It has been proposed that serotonin effects in the brain might be linked to changes in glutamatergic transmission. Extracellular glutamate levels are regulated primarily by glial glutamate transporters. Qualitative evaluation of glutamate transporter immunolabeling in cortex of control and drug-treated mice revealed no discernable difference in intensity of glutamate transporter immunoreactivity. These data suggest that changes in intracellular and extracellular levels of serotonin do not cause concomitant changes in astroglial glutamate transporter expression  and thus cannot represent a mechanism for the delayed efficacy of antidepressants when administered clinically."

Twenty-eight subjects (mean age 125.1 +/- 33.5 months) with a PDD received escitalopram at a dose that increased weekly to a maximum dose of 20 mg as tolerated. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Version (ABC-CV) and the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) were used to assess outcome.RESULTS: There was significant improvement in ABC-CV Irritability Subscale Scores (baseline mean 20.5 +/- 5.9 to final mean 10.9 +/- 7.2; p &lt; or = .001) and in the other ABC-CV Subscales. Improvement on Clinical Global Improvement Scale severity rating was also significant (baseline mean 5.2 +/- 1.0 to final mean 4.6 +/- 1.2; p &lt; or = .001). Twenty-five percent of the subjects responded at a dose less than 10 mg and did not tolerate the 10-mg dose  and an additional 36% responded at a dose greater than or equal to 10 mg. Final dose was unrelated to weight and only weakly correlated with age.CONCLUSIONS: This open-label study found escitalopram to be useful in treating some difficulties common in PDDs. A wide variability in dose was found that could not be accounted for by weight and only partially by age. The study provides information useful for the design of double-blind  placebo-controlled studies of escitalopram in PDDs."

In contrast  a growing body of empirical evidence supports the use of a few forms of theory-based and empirically validated treatment for some aspects of the core features of autism. These include behavioral/psychoeducational interventions and specific forms of medication treatment  which can produce significant improvements in communication  social interaction  and problem behaviors that both maintain over time and generalize across settings. While there is no doubt that treatment and educational services for persons with autism have improved over the past 6 decades  it also appears that significant issues remain with respect to (1) the routine application of validated treatments for the majority of cases with autism  (2) the resistance to even validated forms of treatment for a substantial minority of cases with autism  and (3) the extent to which validated treatments effectively treat the specific core features of autism that are most disabling for persons with autism and their families."

"199","24930787","Obsessive-compulsive disorder and spectrum across the life span.","An obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) spectrum has been proposed  which includes a group of disorders that share certain features with OCD including clinical symptoms (repetitive behaviours and thoughts)  neurobiology (e.g. neurotransmitters) and preferential response to anti-obsessional treatments  such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Three distinct clusters have been identified within the OCD spectrum  i.e. disorders concerning preoccupations with bodily sensations or appearance  impulsive disorders  and neurologically based disorders  and these share phenotypic features. Using one example from each of these clusters  body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)  pathological gambling (PG) and autism  respectively  the phenomenology  neurobiology and pharmacotherapy indicates that specific biological factors are shared by OCD and by these disorders and correlate with the severity of repetitive behaviours. Thus  in common with OCDs  in BDD there is increased activity in the limbic regions; in PG there is evidence of deficiencies in 5-HT function and receptors; and in autism there are restricted interests and repetitive behaviours which may be influenced by serotonergic mechanisms. Our findings support the notion that targeted treatments  for example using SSRIs  for the behaviours associated with these disorders are effective. Our review considers one SSRI treatment in particular  fluvoxamine  and conclusions should be drawn in light of this. Further testing of our hypothesis would be prudent to confirm its validity."

This study examines the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor liquid fluoxetine in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood and adolescent autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In total  45 child or adolescent patients with ASD were randomized into two acute 8-week phases in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of liquid fluoxetine. Study design included two randomized 8-week fluoxetine and placebo phases separated by a 4-week washout phase. Outcome measures included measures of repetitive behaviors and global improvement. Low-dose liquid fluoxetine (mean final dose: 9.9+/-4.35 mg/day) was superior to placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors by CY-BOCS compulsion scale. The effect size was in the moderate to large range  and the doses used were low. Liquid fluoxetine was only slightly  and not significantly  superior to placebo on CGI autism score partially due to a phase order effect. However  fluoxetine was marginally superior to placebo on a composite measure of global effectiveness. Liquid fluoxetine did not significantly differ from placebo on treatment emergent side effects. Liquid fluoxetine in low doses is more effective than placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood autism. Limitations include small sample size and the crossover design of the study. Further replication and long-term maintenance trials are needed."

For other disruptive symptoms (irritability  aggression  self injury)  both older antipsychotics and newer atypical antipsychotics have been shown to have helpful effects. Because of potential side effects  atypical antipsychotics should ordinarily be preferred over older agents.

A small and largely imperfect literature suggests that beta blockers  mood stabilizers  and alpha-2 agonists may also have some role for treating such symptoms.

"211","14521196","Why have drug treatments been so disappointing?","The title of this contribution involves two consecutive questions: have the effects of medication in autism indeed been disappointing? And if so  why? The answer to the first question depends on whether one focuses on the core social and communicative deficits of autism  or on various complicating behaviour problems. Attempts over the past decades to develop drugs that specifically improve social and communicative functioning have failed. Among the most ambitious attempts were medical interventions in the endogenous opioid system that were motivated from animal models on the involvement of this system in various aspects of social behaviour. By contrast  medications such as the newer antipsychotics  psychostimulants  presynaptic noradrenergic blocking agents (clonidine and guanfacine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were shown to reduce impairing complicating symptoms of affective instability  irritability  hyperactivity and inattentiveness  aggression  self-injury and stereotypies. The explanation for the medication-refractory status of social and communicative deficits should be sought in at least two related factors: (1) the as yet unidentified neurochemical basis of autism  and (2) the obvious lack of involvement of the main neurotransmitter systems (dopamine  noradrenaline and serotonin) in the pathophysiology of social and communicative behaviour."
"212","12957098","Targeted treatments for symptom domains in child and adolescent autism.","CONTEXT: The number of people with autism spectrum disorders has dramatically increased over the past decade  and problem behaviours in autism are an increasing challenge to families  schools  physicians  and other health-care professionals. Pharmacological treatments can effectively target problem behaviours associated with autism.STARTING POINT: Recently  L Namerow and colleagues (J Dev Behav Pediatr 2003; 24: 104-08) presented preliminary data in children and adolescents with autism treated with citalopram  which suggested that selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are useful in the reduction of symptom domains such as repetitive behaviours and mood disorders. J McCracken and colleagues (N Engl J Med 2000; 347: 314-21) showed that the atypical antipsychotic risperidone reduced serious behavioural problems  such as tantrums  aggression  or self-injury in children with autism and in children with below-average intelligence quotients. These and other studies show how developments in study design  selection of patients  and outcome measures have allowed treatment trials in autism to progress beyond anecdotal reports and case observations  and show reduction in the severity of specific symptom domains within these disorders. WHERE NEXT? In therapeutic intervention the risk of treatment toxicity must be balanced against the benefits of improved symptom severity. The newer methods enable informed decisions about which patients will benefit from which treatments. Other symptom domains within autism and effects on development need to be evaluated in adequately designed clinical trials. Future strategies include extending treatment to children as young as the preschool years."

To create better treatment  we studied here clinical adverse effects of fluvoxamine and correlated them with genetic polymorphism of two genes  the promoter region of serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and serotonin 2A receptor gene (5-HT2AR). Twenty-eight subjects  consisting of 23 boys and 5 girls  aged from 3 to 18 years old diagnosed as having autistic disorder were analyzed during fluvoxamine administration. The dosages and duration of fluvoxamine treatment are 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day and 2 weeks to 17 months (mean 7.9 months)  respectively. There were several clinical adverse effects such as sleep disturbance in 9 cases  climb up to high places in 8  gastrointestinal symptoms in 6  hyperactivities in 5  excitement in 4  general fatigability in 2 and urticaria in 1. Medication was discontinued in 2 patients with fatigability and 1 with sleep disturbance  diarrhea and poor appetite. There was no significant correlation between genetic polymorphism in 5-HTTLPR and the occurrence of clinical adverse effects of fluvoxamine. However hyperactivity was significantly more frequent in the subjects with 102T/102T polymorphism of 5-HT2AR  and patients with sleep disturbance were significantly less frequent in the subjects with 102C/102C polymorphism. We conclude that the clinical adverse effects such as climb up to high places and hyperactivity during fluvoxamine treatment may be relatively specific in children  and that genetic polymorphism of 5-HT2AR may be related to the appearance of clinical adverse effects."

Genetic variation of the serotonin receptor may influence the efficacy of fluvoxamine treatment. We studied the correlation between clinical responses to fluvoxamine and serotonin receptor gene polymorphism (5-HT2AR) in children with an autistic disorder. Eighteen patients completed a 12-week double-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized crossover study. Clinical global impression (CGI) by child neurologists and interviews for parents were assessed after 12 weeks of fluvoxamine treatment. Behavioral assessments consisting of 20 items by newly created Behavioral Assessment Scale (BAS) were obtained before as well as 6 and 12 weeks after treatment. For genotyping of 5-HT2AR  102 T/C polymorphism was analyzed by the PCR method. Seven cases of T/T  6 of T/C and 5 of C/C were identified. The patients with the genotype T/C responded more favorably when estimated by CGI and parents' report at 12 weeks of treatment. Although not significant statistically (p = 0.0578)  the number of improved BAS items in these patients were larger after fluvoxamine than placebo treatment. On analyses of individual BAS items  the patients with the genotype C/C showed improvement of unnatural facial expression  which was significant at 6 weeks  but not at 12 weeks  of fluvoxamine treatment. In the patients with the genotype T/C  eye movements and emotional changes were significantly improved at 12 weeks of treatment. Our results suggested that genetic polymorphism of 102 T/C in the 5-HT2AR gene may have influence on the response to fluvoxamine treatment for patients with an autistic disorder. Because of the small numbers of subject studied here  further studies are needed. The methods of fluvoxamine treatment  such as appropriate dosage and treatment duration  should also be clarified."
"220","12589395","Synergistic action of 5-HT2A antagonists and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in neuropsychiatric disorders.","Recently  the addition of drugs with prominent 5-HT(2) receptor antagonist properties (risperidone  olanzapine  mirtazapine  and mianserin) to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been shown to enhance therapeutic responses in patients with major depression and treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). These 5-HT(2) antagonists may also be effective in ameliorating some symptoms associated with autism and other pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). At the doses used  these drugs would be expected to saturate 5-HT(2A) receptors. These findings suggest that the simultaneous blockade of 5-HT(2A) receptors and activation of an unknown constellation of other 5-HT receptors indirectly as a result of 5-HT uptake inhibition might have greater therapeutic efficacy than either action alone. Animal studies have suggested that activation of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors may counteract the effects of activating 5-HT(2A) receptors. Additional 5-HT receptors  such as the 5-HT(1B/1D/5/7) receptors  may similarly counteract the effects of 5-HT(2A) receptor activation. These clinical and preclinical observations suggest that the combination of highly selective 5-HT(2A) antagonists and SSRIs  as well as strategies to combine high-potency 5-HT(2A) receptor and 5-HT transporter blockade in a single compound  offer the potential for therapeutic advances in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders."

The purpose of this study was to examine the benefits and adverse effects of citalopram in a group of children and adolescents with PDDs. Target behaviors included aggression  anxiety  stereotypies  and preoccupations. Seventeen patients with PDDs (14 with autistic disorder  three with Asperger's disorder) (mean age = 9.4 +/- 2.9 years; range 4-15 years) were treated with citalopram for at least 2 months (mean duration of treatment = 7.4 +/- 5.3 months; range 1-15 months). Treatment was initiated at a low dose (5 mg daily) and was increased by 5 mg weekly as tolerated and as necessary. The mean final dose was 19.7 +/- 7.8 mg (range 5-40 mg). Outcome was based on a consensus between clinician and parents  using the Improvement item of the Clinical Global Impressions Scale as a guide. Ten (59%) children were judged to be much improved or very much improved regarding target behaviors. Core symptoms of PDDs (social interactions  communication) did not show clinically significant improvement. Citalopram was generally well tolerated  although four patients developed treatment-limiting adverse effects: two with increased agitation  one with insomnia  and one with possible tics. The results of this case series suggest that citalopram has beneficial effects on some interfering behaviors associated with PDDs with few adverse effects. Controlled trials are warranted."

Response criteria are described. Family histories were obtained using the family history method in repeated interviews. Fluoxetine response  family history of major affective disorder  and unusual intellectual achievement  pretreatment language  and hyperlexia were used to define a coherent subgroup of autistic spectrum disorder. Statistical analyses were post hoc. Of the children  22 (17%) had an excellent response  67 (52%) good  and 40 (31%) fair/poor. Treatment age did not correlate with response. Fluoxetine response correlated robustly with familial major affective disorder and unusual intellectual achievement  and with hyperlexia in the child. Family history of bipolar disorder and of unusual intellectual achievement correlated strongly. Five children developed bipolar disorder during follow-up. Fluoxetine response  family history of major affective disorder (especially bipolar)  unusual achievement  and hyperlexia in the children appear to define a homogeneous autistic subgroup. Bipolar disorder  unusual intellectual achievement  and autistic spectrum disorders cluster strongly in families and may share genetic determinants."

Twenty-three children completed the study and showed significant improvement on three subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (Irritability  Hyperactivity  and Excessive Speech) and the TARGET. The final mean dose was 10.7 mg/day. Several aspects of communication were also improved after olanzapine treatment. However  only three children were considered responders in terms of the Clinical Global Impression of Severity/Improvement scores. The most important adverse events were weight gain  increased appetite  and loss of strength. Three children showed extrapyramidal symptoms that disappeared after the dose was lowered. Thus  while olanzapine was a relatively safe medication in children  its clinical relevance in children with pervasive developmental disorder may be limited."
"226","12232775","Serotonin transporter promoter variants in autism: functional effects and relationship to platelet hyperserotonemia.","The well-replicated platelet hyperserotonemia of autism has stimulated interest in serotonin (5-HT) in autism. We have examined the effects of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT  locus SLC6A4) promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) on platelet 5-HT physiology in autism. Platelet 5-HT uptake rates and affinities (V(max) and K(m))  uptake site densities (B(max)) and 5-HT levels were examined in 31 French individuals with autism genotyped with respect to the 5-HTTLPR. Platelet 5-HT uptake and 5-HT levels were measured using HPLC; uptake sites were determined by radioligand binding. A 1.5-fold increased rate (V(max)) of platelet 5-HT uptake was observed in ll genotype individuals compared to those with ls and ss genotypes (Mann- Whitney U-test  P = 0.022). However  no significant relationship was observed between genotype and uptake site density (U-test  P = 0.51). Although median levels of platelet 5-HT in platelet-rich plasma were higher in the ll group  only trend level significance was observed (U-test  P= 0.069); platelet 5-HT content measured in whole blood was similar across genotypes. Uptake rates were well correlated with B(max) values (r = 0.66  P = 0.002); correlations between uptake and platelet 5-HT levels and between B(max) values and 5-HT levels were somewhat lower. While 5-HTTLPR alleles had an appreciable effect on platelet 5-HT uptake rates  effects on 5-HT levels and uptake site density were smaller or absent. Based on these preliminary data and prior studies of allele frequencies  we conclude that the 5-HTTLPR is not a major determinant of the group mean platelet serotonin elevation seen in autism. However  a role for increased uptake in the hyperserotonemia of autism can not be ruled out. In addition  it appears that studies of platelet 5-HT measures in autism and other disorders should take account of the effects of 5-HTTLPR genotype on 5-HT uptake"

Little is known about the age-related brain pharmacokinetics of SSRIs; there is a lack of data regarding optimal dosing of medications for children. The authors used fluorine magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((19)F MRS) to evaluate age effects on whole-brain concentrations of fluvoxamine and fluoxetine in children taking SSRIs.METHOD: Twenty-one pediatric subjects with diagnoses of autistic disorder or other pervasive developmental disorders  6-15 years old and stabilized with a consistent dose of fluvoxamine or fluoxetine  were recruited for the study; 16 successfully completed the imaging protocol. Whole-brain drug levels in this group were compared to similarly acquired data from 28 adults.RESULTS: A significant relationship between dose and brain drug concentration was observed for both drugs across the age range studied. Brain fluvoxamine concentration in the children was lower  consistent with a lower dose/body mass drug prescription; when brain concentration was adjusted for dose/mass  age effects were no longer significant. Brain fluoxetine concentration was similar between age groups; no significant age effects on brain fluoxetine drug levels remained after adjustment for dose/mass. Observations of brain fluoxetine bioavailability and elimination half-life also were similar between age groups.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that fluvoxamine or fluoxetine prescriptions adjusted for dose/mass are an acceptable treatment approach for medicating children with autistic disorder or other pervasive developmental disorders. It must be determined whether these findings can be generalized to other pediatric populations."

Other abnormalities include seizures  electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities  affective instability  impulsivity  and aggression. Divalproex sodium is indicated as both an anticonvulsant in epilepsy and a mood stabilizer in bipolar illness and thus might be useful for these complicating symptoms in autism.METHOD: A retrospective pilot study was conducted to determine whether divalproex sodium was effective in treating core dimensions and associated features of autism. Fourteen patients who met DSM-IV criteria for autism  Asperger's disorder  or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified  both with and without a history of seizure disorders or EEG abnormalities  were openly treated with divalproex sodium. Improvement was assessed via the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale.RESULTS: Of 14 patients who completed a trial of divalproex sodium  10 (71%) were rated as having sustained response to treatment. The mean dose of divalproex sodium was 768 mg/day (range  125-2500 mg/day)  and it was generally well tolerated. Improvement was noted in core symptoms of autism and associated features of affective instability  impulsivity  and aggression.CONCLUSION: Divalproex sodium may be beneficial to patients with autism spectrum disorders  particularly those with associated features of affective instability  impulsivity  and aggression as well as those with a history of EEG abnormalities or seizures. Of note  all patients with an abnormal EEG and/or seizure history were rated as responders. However  these findings must be interpreted with caution  given the open retrospective nature of the study.

It was hypothesized that clomipramine would be better tolerated than haloperidol and prove superior on a measure of stereotypy. Individuals with a DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder (mean age  16.3 years; range  10-36 years) were randomly assigned  by using a Latin square design  to the following 7-week trials: placebo  clomipramine (mean daily dose  128.4 mg; range  100-150 mg)  or haloperidol (mean daily dose  1.3 mg; range  1-1.5 mg). Data on 36 subjects were analyzed and taken together; the results favored haloperidol. In those patients who were able to complete a full therapeutic trial  clomipramine proved comparable to haloperidol in terms of improvement compared with baseline. However  significantly fewer individuals receiving clomipramine versus haloperidol were able to complete the trial (37.5% vs. 69.7%  respectively) for reasons related to both side effects and efficacy or behavior problems. In the intent-to-treat sample  which is perhaps more clinically relevant  only haloperidol proved superior to baseline on a global measure of autistic symptom severity  as well as specific measures for irritability and hyperactivity. Clomipramine did not seem more effective on a measure of stereotypy  nor was it better tolerated."

Early studies of serotonin re-uptake inhibitors appear promising but may not be indicated for all age groups. Small  controlled studies of methylphenidate and clonidine indicate a possible role for these medications in the treatment of hyperactivity in autism.

CGI-severity was used to assess the severity and the improvement of symptoms. Individual symptoms improvement was assessed by both parents and therapists. Fluoxetine dose was titrated in all patients from 1.2 ml/day to reach a final doses of 3 6 or 5 ml/day in four weeks. Tolerance was assessed by collecting spontaneous adverse events.RESULTS: 11 children completed the study. Children experienced a moderate or marked improvement (final score in CGI 3 to 5). Communication and attention skills were improved. There were also a decrease of rituals  stereotypies and repetitive behaviours. Most common adverse events were increase of impulsivity and restlessness  other events were sleep disturbances and lost of appetite. 6 children needed concomitant medication with carbamacepine and 1 with levopromacine along the study.CONCLUSIONS: These results support that Fluoxetine at doses of 5 ml/day (20 mg/day) could help to improve some symptoms in Pervasive Developmental Disordersand allow to increase the effectiveness of therapies in these patients.

"242","11239907","Reactivity of serotonin in whole blood: relationship with drug response in obsessive-compulsive disorder.","BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder responds almost only to potent serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

The decrease of WB-5-HT after 1 week of serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment correlated negatively with clinical outcome after 12 weeks (r = -.61  p =.0006); hence  patients with slower WB-5-HT reactivity eventually responded better to treatment. Baseline WB-5-HT  but not WB-5-HT reactivity  was related to season. Depression  autistic traits  and previous serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment predicted nonresponse.CONCLUSIONS: A fast decrease of WB-5-HT was associated with poor clinical outcome. This may be related to faster serotonin efflux from platelets  which has previously been linked to autism. Further studies are necessary to identify the underlying mechanism and discern whether serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced WB-5-HT decrease is clinically useful."
"243","11172878","The effects of inositol treatment in animal models of psychiatric disorders.","Clinical trials indicate that inositol may be effective in the treatment of patients with depression  panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)  but not in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia  Alzheimer's disease  ADHD or autism. This spectrum of clinical action parallels that of serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  but inositol is a precursor in the phosphatidylinositol cycle  a second messenger system distal to the receptor for 5HT-2. To study its mechanism of therapeutic action there is a need to test inositol's activity in animal models of psychopathology. In rats  chronic inositol was demonstrated to increase activity levels  reduce immobility time in the forced swim test and in the reserpine-induced hypoactivity models of depression  and reduce anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus-maze. The reduction in anxiety-like behaviors appears to be related to baseline levels of activity. Inositol treatment was not observed to have any effect on amphetamine-induced hyperactivity  apomorphine-induced stereotypy  or on the performance of memory tasks by monkeys. Clinical controlled trials of inositol in patients with depression  panic disorder  and OCD were small  and positive psychoactive effects in animals clearly strengthen the case for further clinical trials and potential for general therapeutic use in humans."

Between 10 and 20 % of subjects with autism have macrocephalia  which is in accordance with MRI findings of an increased total brain tissue volume and enlargement most prominent in the occipital and parietal lobes. The most robust and well-replicated neurobiological abnormality in autism is an elevation of whole blood serotonin found in over 30% of the patients.

Relative to other SSRIs  fluvoxamine is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6  a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2. In randomised  double-blind trials. fluvoxamine 100 to 300 mg/day for 6 to 10 weeks significantly reduced symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) compared with placebo.

Relative to other SSRIs  fluvoxamine is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6  a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2. In randomised  double-blind trials. fluvoxamine 100 to 300 mg/day for 6 to 10 weeks significantly reduced symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) compared with placebo. Response rates of 38 to 52% have been reported with fluvoxamine  compared with response rates of 0 to 18% with placebo. In patients with OCD  fluvoxamine had similar efficacy to that of clomipramine and  in smaller trials  the SSRIs paroxetine and citalopram and was significantly more effective than desipramine. Maintenance therapy with fluvoxamine may reduce the likelihood of relapses in up to 67% of patients with OCD.

Fewer anticholinergic or cardiovascular events are associated with fluvoxamine than tricyclic antidepressants. Although comparative data are lacking  the tolerability profile of fluvoxamine appears to be broadly similar to those of other SSRIs.CONCLUSION: Fluvoxamine has demonstrated short term efficacy in the treatment of OCD  panic disorder  social phobia  PTSD and in a range of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders. The drug is as effective as clomipramine in patients with OCD but appears to have a better tolerability profile. On the basis of current treatment guidelines  fluvoxamine  like other SSRIs  is recommended as first-line treatment for a number of anxiety disorders. It appears to offer some pharmacokinetic advantages and a different drug interaction profile to the other SSRIs with a broadly similar spectrum of adverse events. However  direct comparisons are required to assess the relative efficacy and tolerability of the different agents of this drug class."
"250","11071017","Increased density of the platelet serotonin transporter in autism.","BACKGROUND: Various data have shown the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in autism. The presence of the 5-HT transporter in platelets  similar to the same structure located in presynaptic serotonergic neurons  has produced a series of studies aimed at assessing its functionality in this disorder  but the ensuing findings are quite controversial. For this reason  we investigated the 5-HT transporter by means of the specific binding of [3H]-Paroxetine ([3H]-Par)  which is currently considered the first-choice ligand for labeling it  in platelets of 20 autistic children and adolescents  as compared with healthy control subjects.METHODS: Twenty children and adolescents of both sexes suffering from autism according to DSM IV criteria were included in the study and compared with a similar group of healthy control subjects. Platelet membranes and the binding of [3H]-Par were carried out according to standardized protocols.RESULTS: The results showed a significantly higher density of [3H]-Par binding sites in autistic children than in healthy control subjects.CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the presence of a serotonergic dysfunction in autism and would suggest that the 5-HT transporter may have a specific role in this disorder  also in the light of its recently proposed role in brain development."
"251","11021352","Is there a basis for novel pharmacotherapy of autism?","No medication has yet been shown to consistently alter the symptoms or the course of autism in the majority of patients. The present pharmacotherapy is mainly palliative and sometimes effective in attenuating specific behaviors. The search for better treatment involves examination of the underlying pathophysiology  the genetic or environmental etiology (including possible iatrogenic causes)  and assessment of the clinically-generated evidence of efficacy  including serendipitous or unexplained findings. Subtle neuroanatomic and neurochemical changes are being explored and there are anecdotal reports or limited clinical trials that suggest some therapy might be possible. Secretin is a surprising recent addition to the list of candidates. The pharmacologic mechanism by which these agents might provide such effect is not clear  but hypotheses are beginning to emerge. In addition  the prevention of some uncertain number of autism cases is being investigated by examination of certain vaccinations as putative causative or contributory factors. These topics are reviewed in this article  which has the additional purpose of stimulating novel drug discovery efforts for this enigmatic disorder."

The prevalence of autism is approximately 1 per 2 000; the prevalence of autism and Asperger's disorder together is 1 per 1 000. The Checklist for Autism in Toddlers is a useful screening instrument for 18-month-old children; the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule are instruments of choice for research. Although twin and family studies clearly support genetic factors as important in autism  linkage analysis studies indicate that many genes may be involved. There is no one treatment of choice. Social-pragmatic approaches  augmented by individualized strategies and social coaching  may be best for teaching social communication skills. Pharmacological interventions have a limited role in improving social communication  but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical neuroleptic medications may help ameliorate aggression  hyperactivity  and other secondary problems.CONCLUSIONS: Private and government agencies must continue to support basic and applied research."
"253","10902094","The pharmacotherapy of target symptoms associated with autistic disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders.","Research into the pharmacotherapy of autistic disorder has steadily increased over the past two decades. Several psychoactive medications have shown efficacy for selected symptoms of autistic disorder and can be used to augment critical educational and behavioral interventions that are the mainstays of treatment. A comprehensive review of medication trials conducted in individuals with autistic disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders is presented. The typical antipsychotic haloperidol is the best-studied medication in autistic disorder but is associated with a high rate of dyskinesias. Investigations to date suggest that the atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone have efficacy for certain symptoms of autistic disorder and may be better tolerated than typical antipsychotics. Preliminary results from trials with serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are favorable  although efficacy has not been demonstrated in younger age groups. Recent controlled studies of nalfrexone suggest that the drug has minimal efficacy. In two small controlled investigations  clonidine was more effective than placebo for a variety of symptoms  including hyperactivity and irritability; in one of these studies  however  the majority of patients relapsed within several months. Psychostimulants reduced hyperactivity and irritability in one small double-blind crossover study in children with autistic disorder  although these agents are frequently reported to exacerbate irritability  insomnia  and aggression in clinical populations. Recent controlled trials of secretin have not shown efficacy compared to placebo. Several other medications  including buspirone  mood stabilizers  and beta-blockers  have produced symptom reduction in some open-label studies and may warrant controlled investigation."

While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating core symptoms of autism  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). An open  retrospective clinical study with venlafaxine evaluated its effect on core symptoms of autism as well as associated features of ADHD. Ten consecutive subjects meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  4th edition (DSM-IV)  criteria for an autism spectrum disorder were treated with venlafaxine  initiated at 12.5 mg per day and adjusted on a flexible basis. Six of 10 completers were judged to be sustained treatment responders  by scoring 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the Clinical Global Impressions improvement scale. Venlafaxine was effective in low dosages (mean  24.37 mg/day; range  6.25 to 50 mg/day) and was well tolerated. Improvement was noted in repetitive behaviors and restricted interests  social deficits  communication and language function  inattention  and hyperactivity. Controlled treatment trials with venlafaxine are warranted in autism spectrum disorders."

This study examines serotonergic and noradrenergic markers in a study group of 13 male  post-pubertal  caucasian autistic patients (age 12-18 y; I.Q. &gt; 55) and 13 matched volunteers. [3H]-paroxetine binding Kd values were significantly higher in patients with autism than in healthy volunteers. Plasma concentrations of tryptophan  the precursor of 5-HT  were significantly lower in autistic patients than in healthy volunteers. There were no significant differences between autistic and normal children in the serum concentrations of 5-HT  or the 24-hr urinary excretion of 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)  adrenaline  noradrenaline  and dopamine. There were no significant differences in [3H]-rauwolscine binding Bmax or Kd values  or in the serum concentrations of tyrosine  the precursor of noradrenaline  between both study groups. There were highly significant positive correlations between age and 24-hr urinary excretion of 5-HIAA and serum tryptophan. The results suggest that: 1) serotonergic disturbances  such as defects in the 5-HT transporter system and lowered plasma tryptophan  may play a role in the pathophysiology of autism; 2) autism is not associated with alterations in the noradrenergic system; and 3) the metabolism of serotonin in humans undergoes significant changes between the ages of 12 and 18 years."

To date  however  there are few controlled studies of these agents in children with PDD  so definitive evidence is lacking. Despite preliminary results in favor of naltrexone  neuroleptic medication appears to be effective for reducing aggression  self-injurious behavior  agitation  and stereotypies. The primary drawback with traditional neuroleptics is risk of short- and long-term side effects. The newer atypical neuroleptics have the potential for benefit with fewer extrapyramidal side effects  but more study is needed to establish their efficacy and safety. Children on neuroleptic medications should be started at the lowest possible dose  with gradual increases until clinical benefit is observed. The likelihood of untoward side effects is increased if the medication dose is increased rapidly. Baseline measurement of target behaviors can be aided by using standardized scales. The presence of abnormal movements should be assessed before initiating treatment and at regular intervals during the course of treatment--including after medication withdrawal. Weight gain is emerging as a recurrent side effect with the atypical neuroleptics. Thus  weight should be monitored  and the family should be advised about a diet baseline. As with all treatments of children with severe behavioral difficulties  pharmacotherapy should be instituted in the context of an integrated treatment plan."
"259","10226932","The 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907 is more effective in counteracting NMDA antagonist- than dopamine agonist-induced hyperactivity in mice.","The purpose of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of the selective 5-HT2A antagonist M100907 in different psychosis models. The classical neuroleptic haloperidol was used as reference compound. Two hyperdopaminergia and two hypoglutamatergia mouse models were used. Hyperdopaminergia was produced by the DA releaser d-amphetamine or the DA uptake inhibitor GBR 12909. Hypoglutamatergia was produced by the un-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 or the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist D-CPPene. M100907 was found to counteract the locomotor stimulant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 and D-CPPene  but spontaneous locomotion  d-amphetamine- and GBR-12909-induced hyperactivity were not significantly affected. Haloperidol  on the other hand  antagonized both NMDA antagonist- and DA agonist-induced hyperactivity  as well as spontaneous locomotion in the highest dose used. Based on the present and previous results we draw the conclusion that 5-HT2A receptor antagonists are particularly effective against behavioural anomalies resulting from hypoglutamatergia of various origins. The clinical implications of our results and conclusions would be that a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist  due to i a the low side effect liability  could be the preferable treatment strategy in various disorders associated with hypoglutamatergia; such conditions might include schizophrenia  childhood autism and dementia disorders."

Compulsiveness is associated with increased frontal lobe activity and increased serotonergic activity  while impulsiveness is associated with reduced activity of these variables. Neural circuits affected by serotonergic pathways have been identified and pharmacological challenge of OCSD patients with serotonin receptor agonists have supported the involvement of serotonergic processes.CONCLUSIONS: SSRIs such as fluvoxamine have established efficacy in OCD and preliminary studies indicate that they are also effective in OCSDs.

The initial sample included 18 patients with autistic disorder  6 patients with Asperger's disorder  and 11 patients with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS). Behavioral ratings were obtained at baseline and after 4  8  and 12 weeks of clomipramine. Eighteen (55%) of the 33 patients who completed the trial were categorized as treatment responders based on scores of &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) global improvement item (p &lt; 0.001). Ten (63%) of 16 patients with autistic disorder  2 (33%) of 6 patients with Asperger's disorder  and 6 (55%) of 11 patients with PDDNOS were considered responders to clomipramine treatment. In those 18 patients  clomipramine significantly reduced total repetitive thoughts and behavior (p &lt; 0.001) and also aggression (p &lt; 0.001)  and improved some aspects of social relatedness  such as eye contact and verbal responsiveness (p &lt; 0.001). Change in these specific symptom clusters over time was not related to DSM-IV subtype of PDD. The level of autistic behavior  as measured by the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) score  and full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) were not significantly associated with global treatment response. Whereas clomipramine was well tolerated by most patients  13 had clinically significant adverse effects. Three patients had seizures during clomipramine treatment  including 2 who had prior seizure disorders and were taking anticonvulsants. Of the 32 patients who had no history of prior seizures  only 1 had a seizure during clomipramine treatment. There were no adverse cardiovascular or extrapyramidal effects. All responders continued on clomipramine after completion of the study. The results of this open-label trial suggest that clomipramine may be an effective drug for reducing repetitive thoughts and actions and aggressive behavior and for improving some elements of social behavior  such as eye contact and verbal responsivity in adults with PDDs. Careful monitoring of adverse effects  particularly seizures  is warranted. Although an electroencephalogram (EEG) is not mandatory in patients with PDD prior to clomipramine treatment  we recommend that patients with PDD and a history of seizures be treated initially with a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor rather than with clomipramine.

"279","9196923","Psychopharmacologic treatment of pathologic aggression.","Several drugs are apparently effective in treating pathologic anger and aggression. Because many of the studies on aggressive populations allowed the use of concomitant medications  it is unclear whether the efficacy of each drug in a particular population is dependent on the presence of other medications  such as antipsychotic agents. Finally  one needs to be circumspect in inferring efficacy of a particular drug in aggressive patients with neuropsychiatric conditions other than the ones in which some efficacy has been established. Lithium appears to be an effective treatment of aggression among nonepileptic prison inmates  mentally retarded and handicapped patients  and among conduct-disordered children with explosive behavior. Certainly  lithium would be the treatment of choice in bipolar patients with excessive irritability and anger outbursts  and it has been shown to be effective in this population. Anticonvulsant medications are the treatment of choice for patients with outbursts of rage and abnormal EEG findings. The efficacy of these drugs in patients without a seizure disorder  however  remains to be established  with the exception perhaps of valproate and carbamazepine. In fact  dyphenylhydantoin did not appear to be effective in treating aggressive behavior in children with temper tantrums and was found to be effective in only a prison population. There is some evidence for the efficacy of carbamazepine and valproate in treating pathologic aggression in patients with dementia  organic brain syndrome  psychosis  and personality disorders. As Yudofsky et al point out in their review of the literature  although traditional antipsychotic drugs have been used widely to treat aggression  there is little evidence for their effectiveness in treating aggression beyond their sedative effect in agitated patients or their antiaggressive effect among patients whose aggression is related to active psychosis. Antipsychotic agents appear to be effective in treating psychotic aggressive patients  conduct-disordered children  and mentally retarded patients  with only modest effects in the management of pathologic aggression in patients with dementia. Furthermore  at least in one study  these drugs were found to be associated with increased aggressiveness in mentally retarded subjects. On the other hand  atypical antipsychotic agents (i.e.  clozapine  risperidone  and olanzapine) may be more effective than traditional antipsychotic drugs in aggressive and violent populations  as they have shown efficacy in patients with dementia  brain injury  mental retardation  and personality disorders. Similarly  benzodiazepines can reduce agitation and irritability in elderly and demented populations  but they also can induce behavioral disinhibition. Therefore  one should be careful in using this class of drugs in patients with pathologic aggression. Beta-blockers appear to be effective in many different neuropsychiatric conditions. These drugs seem effective in reducing violent and assaultive behavior in patients with dementia  brain injury  schizophrenia  mental retardation  and organic brain syndrome. As pointed out by Campbell et al in their review of the literature  however  systematic research is lacking  and little is known about the efficacy and safety of beta-blockers in children and adolescents with pathologic aggression. Although widely used in the management of pathologic aggression  the use of this class of drugs has been limited partially by marked hypotension and bradycardia  which are side effects common at the higher doses. The usefulness of the antihypertensive drug clonidine in the treatment of pathologic aggression has not been assessed adequately  and only marginal benefits were observed with this drug in irritable autistic and conduct disorder children. Psychostimulants seem to be effective in reducing aggressiveness in brain-injured patients as well as in violent adolescents with oppositional or conduct disorders  particu"

Cerebrospinal fluid inositol has been reported as decreased in depression. A double-blind controlled trial of 12 g daily of inositol in 28 depressed patients for four weeks was performed. Significant overall benefit for inositol compared to placebo was found at week 4 on the Hamilton Depression Scale. No changes were noted in hematology  kidney or liver function. Since many antidepressants are effective in panic disorder  twenty-one patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia completed a double-blind  placebo-controlled  four week  random-assignment crossover treatment trial of inositol 12 g per day. Frequency and severity of panic attacks and severity of agoraphobia declined significantly with inositol compared to placebo. Side-effects were minimal. Since serotonin re-uptake inhibitors benefit obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and inositol is reported to reverse desensitization of serotonin receptors  thirteen patients with OCD completed a double-blind controlled crossover trial of 18 g inositol or placebo for six weeks each. Inositol significantly reduced scores of OCD symptoms compared with placebo. A controlled double-blind crossover trial of 12 g daily of inositol for a month in twelve anergic schizophrenic patients  did not show any beneficial effects. A double-blind controlled crossover trial of 6 g of inositol daily vs. glucose for one month each was carried out in eleven Alzheimer patients  with on clearly significant therapeutic effects. Antidepressant drugs have been reported to improve attention deficit disorder (ADDH) with hyperactivity symptomatology. We studied oral inositol in children with ADDH in a double-blind  crossover  placebo-controlled manner. Eleven children  mean age 8.9 +/- 3.6 years were enrolled in an eight week trial of inositol or placebo at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight. Results show a trend for aggravation of the syndrome with myo-inositol as compared to placebo. Recent studies suggest that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are helpful in at least some symptoms of autism. However a controlled double-blind crossover trial of inositol 200 mg/kg per day showed no benefit in nine children with autism. Cholinergic agonists have been reported to ameliorate electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced memory impairment. Inositol metabolism is involved in the second messenger system for several muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Inositol 6 g daily was given in a crossover-double-blind manner for five days before the fifth or sixth ECT to a series of twelve patients  without effect. These results suggest that inositol has therapeutic effects in the spectrum of illness responsive to serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors  including depression  panic and OCD  and is not beneficial in schizophrenia  Alzheimer's ADDH  autism or ECT-induced cognitive impairment."
"281","9192538","Sertraline treatment of transition-associated anxiety and agitation in children with autistic disorder.","The intolerance of children with autistic disorder to changes in their routine or environment is well known  typically presenting with acute symptoms of anxiety  panic  irritability  or agitation. In a clinical sample of children (6-12 years old) with autistic disorder and transition-induced behavioral deterioration  8 of 9 patients showed a clinically significant improvement in response to sertraline treatment. Only one child was taking concurrent psychotropic medication. Therapeutic doses were surprisingly low in all cases (25-50 mg daily)  with a clinical response appearing generally in 2-8 weeks. Adverse effects were minimal (one child developed stomachaches)  except for apparent sertraline-induced behavioral worsening in 2 children when their doses were raised to 75 mg daily. In 3 children  an initial satisfactory clinical response appeared to diminish after 3-7 months of treatment  despite steady or increased doses. In 6 patients  the beneficial effects persisted throughout the several-month follow-up period. Only four of the children's families were identified as having mood and/or anxiety disorders. This open-label study suggests that short-term sertraline treatment may reduce the behavioral reactions seen in association with situational transitions or environmental changes in children with autistic disorder  though the beneficial effect may be only temporary in some children. Our experience suggests that small doses of sertraline may be effective and that some children may require divided doses of sertraline during the day. Controlled studies are needed to determine the efficacy  safety  and pharmacokinetics of sertraline in treating this &quot;need for sameness &quot; both in short-term and long-term studies of children with autistic disorder."

Abnormalities in the serotonin neurotransmitter system have been identified in some persons with autism. No consistently effective and safe drugs have been developed for treating the symptoms of autism.METHODS: Thirty adults with autistic disorder completed a 12-week double-blind  placebo-controlled trial of the potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitor fluvoxamine maleate. Behavioral ratings were obtained at baseline and after 4  8  and 12 weeks of treatment.RESULTS: Eight (53%) of 15 patients in the fluvoxamine-treated group were categorized as responders compared with none of 15 in the placebo group (P = .001). Fluvoxamine was superior to placebo in reducing repetitive thoughts and behavior (P &lt; .001)  maladaptive behavior (P &lt; .001)  and aggression (P &lt; .03)  and in improving some aspects of social relatedness (P &lt; .04)  especially language usage (P &lt; .008). Treatment response was not correlated with age level of autistic behavior  or full-scale IQ. Other than mild sedation and nausea in a few patients  fluvoxamine was well tolerated. No dyskinesias  adverse cardiovascular events  or seizures occurred.CONCLUSIONS: Fluvoxamine is more effective than placebo in the short-term treatment of the symptoms of autistic disorder in adults. Controlled studies of fluvoxamine and other potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitors seem warranted in children and adolescents with autism."

Although the treatment prescribed for these problems has traditionally been neuroleptic medication  serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as sertraline may result in significant clinical improvement as well as fewer side effects.METHOD: The authors administered sertraline in an open trial to nine consecutively admitted adult mentally retarded outpatients presenting with target behaviors of self-injury and/or aggression. Most patients (N = 6) were mildly or moderately mentally retarded by DSM-III-R criteria; five had comorbid autistic disorder. Prescribed dosages ranged from 25 mg to 150 mg daily  based on observed clinical responses. Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) ratings were made at baseline and again after sertraline treatment for at least 28 days.RESULTS: Sertraline led to improvement in CGI ratings of overall clinical severity in eight of nine subjects; mean +/- SD improvement in CGI ratings was 2.44 points +/- 1.67. Discontinuation of the treatment was necessary in only one patient  after 18 weeks of sertraline treatment  because of agitation and worsening of self-picking. Side effects were otherwise minimal.CONCLUSION: These findings from a clinical sample suggest that sertraline is promising in the treatment of self-injury and aggression. Double-blind controlled studies of sertraline and other serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of self-injury and aggression in patients with mental retardation and with autistic disorder are warranted."

Haloperidol  fenfluramine and naltrexone have been the most extensively studied drugs in systematic research. Haloperidol appeared to decrease levels of hyperactivity  stereotypies  emotional lability but also abnormal object relations and social withdrawal. However  the therapeutic effect was generally modest and long term administration was associated with dyskinesias in autistic children. The frequent hyperserotonemia in autism has suggested the use of fenfluramine  an antiserotoninergic agent. Although the initial reports were optimistic  more recent carefully designed studies often failed to show that fenfluramine was superior to placebo. Naltrexone  a potent opiate antagonist  was explored following the opioid hypothesis based on the similarity between autistic symptomatology and abnormal behaviors observed in opiate addicts and in laboratory animals administered opiates and on the abnormalities of endogenous opioids that exit in a subgroup of autistic children. However  the current studies do not concur and no definite conclusions can be made of the efficacy of naltrexone at present time. Low doses of amisulpride which have been shown to improve negative symptoms in schizophrenia and serotoninergic antidepressants  which have proven effective in repetitive and ritualized behaviors  have recently began to be evaluated in controlled studies.

Increases in DOPAC were greater during the second FEN treatment period than the first. Persistent changes in catecholamine regulation may be related to previously reported long-term effects on central nervous system 5-HT after FEN.

"328","2670881","Review of fenfluramine in the treatment of the developmental disabilities.","Fenfluramine  a serotonin reducing agent  has been the subject of intense research effort in recent years. A variety of biochemical studies summarized suggest that some autistic children and many nonautistic severely retarded individuals have elevated blood serotonin concentrations. The research on fenfluramine's clinical efficacy is thoroughly reviewed from a methodological perspective. All studies assessing the drug's effects on blood serotonin have observed reductions in whole blood serotonin to about 50% of baseline concentrations. Although there were early reports of drug enhancement of IQ  there is no good evidence that this is the case. However  there are data to suggest that fenfluramine may enhance social relatedness  reduce stereotypic behavior  lessen overactivity  and improve attention span in some autistic children  although these results do not appear consistently across studies. The animal literature on the neurotoxicity of fenfluramine is reviewed  and a number of limitations in this research are identified that raise questions about its relevance to the pharmacotherapy of children."

A double-blind medication-placebo crossover design was used. Each patient received 1.5 mg/kg fenfluramine daily for 3 months followed and preceded by placebo for 1 month. Clinical improvement was observed in 6 children (responders). It included reduction of behavioral symptoms such as motor activity  anxiety  mood disturbances  and distractibility. Modifications of serotonin (5-HT)  dopamine (DA)  and DA metabolites [homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)] were assessed at urinary levels. Responders and nonresponders showed a significant decrease of urinary 5-HT levels on fenfluramine. The main differences between the two groups of subjects were found with HVA  the major metabolite of DA. Fenfluramine significantly increased HVA levels in responders whereas no significant modification was found in nonresponders. Moreover the initial level of HVA (lower in responders) significantly differentiated the two groups. These results suggest that the clinical response to fenfluramine could be related to the dopaminergic action of this drug and that urinary DA metabolite levels could be considered as indicators of the responsiveness to fenfluramine treatment in children with autistic behavior."

Pharmacological effects include inhibition of serotonin neurons  decrease of striatal levels of serotonin and metabolites  and reduction in serotonin binding sites. Buspirone also has effects on dopamine  norepinephrine  and the GABA systems. To pursue an antiserotonergic treatment rationale for autistic disorder  an open-blind 4-week trial comparing buspirone to fenfluramine or methylphenidate was conducted. Hyperactivity was a target symptom in three children with improvement noted in two with buspirone. Behavioral toxicity was encountered in one of two autistic subjects treated with methylphenidate and very mild improvement in another subject on fenfluramine. An autistic child with obsessive ideation was unchanged. No adverse reaction to buspirone was encountered. Further investigation in a double-blind trial of buspirone is warranted for treatment of symptoms of autism  especially aggression and hyperactivity."
"331","2919950","Serotonergic responsivity in male young adults with autistic disorder. Results of a pilot study.","Altered serotonergic function has been postulated to exist in autistic disorder. Central serotonergic responsivity was assessed with a neuroendocrine challenge test in seven male young adults with autistic disorder and in seven age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Binding indexes and physiologic responsivity of the platelet serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptor complex were also measured  as was whole-blood serotonin content. Compared with controls  autistic subjects had substantially blunted prolactin release in response to a 60-mg oral dose of fenfluramine hydrochloride  an indirect serotonin agonist [corrected]. Furthermore  the magnitude of serotonin-amplified platelet aggregation  mediated by the platelet 5-HT2 receptor complex  was reduced in the autistic group  as was the mean number of platelet 5-HT2 receptor sites. Among autistic subjects  fenfluramine-induced prolactin release correlated positively with the serotonin-amplified platelet aggregation response and negatively with whole-blood serotonin content. The results of the present study are compatible with the hypothesis that central serotonergic responsivity is decreased in male autistic young adults. Correlations between central and peripheral serotonergic measures in autistic subjects suggest that systemic alterations in serotonergic function may occur in autism."

Modifications of both amplitude and single-trial potential variability were considered according to the clinical and biochemical responsiveness to this drug. Six children (responders) were clinically improved by the treatment. Electrophysiological data were affected according to the clinical and biochemical responsiveness to fenfluramine: the auditory evoked potential amplitude increased  and the single-trial potential variability decreased at each intensity level only in responders whose dopaminergic metabolism was significantly modified by fenfluramine treatment.

Nine children with infantile autism were treated with fenfluramine in double-blind  placebo-crossover design. Transient anorexia was the only adverse effect. Autistic behavior was reported to improve in three patients  but objective psychometric tests were unchanged. Beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity was determined in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid of patients during and before or after treatment with fenfluramine and then was compared to normal controls. Beta-endorphin was elevated significantly in the baseline autistic group (p less than .005) and was reduced toward control values during fenfluramine treatment.

No significant difference in the serotonin concentration per milliliter of whole blood or per 1000 platelets was found between groups for autistic  retarded  or normal children  but the values for those with Down syndrome were significantly lower. A double-blind cross-over study on the effect of fenfluramine versus placebo in seven autistic boys over a period of 8 months demonstrated a significant decrease in blood serotonin levels during the fenfluramine phase in all subjects. Slight improvements were found in short-term auditory memory and some measures of receptive language skills  particularly in children functioning at a high level. There was no significant change in global psychometric measurements of general intelligence during therapy. No adverse clinical effect was observed other than weight loss of 6% in one child.

The behavior modification program used was adapted from Reiss's program  an approach that had proven effective in individuals with hyperphagia and overweight who had no additional emotional problems or brain damage. In our patient the problem was complicated by the presence of autism  with compulsive eating being particularly ingrained as a form of stereotyped behavior. We therefore decided to administer fenfluramine concurrently because it is known to have both an appetite-depressing effect and a positive effect on behavioral disturbances characteristic of autistic individuals. During inpatient treatment the girl lost weight and showed changes in behavior. The changed eating behavior was still being maintained many months after discharge and after fenfluramine had been discontinued. We assume that drug treatment provided an important kind of support for the behavioral treatment program. Further  we attribute the emotional stabilization in this autistic girl to fenfluramine. We now plan to extend this treatment approach to other subjects with similar problems."
