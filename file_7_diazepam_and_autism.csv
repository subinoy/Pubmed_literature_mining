Their high affinity binding site is located at the interface between the <U+03B3>2 and the adjacent a subunit. The a-subunit gene family consists of six members and receptors can be homomeric or mixed with respect to the a-subunits. Previous work has suggested that benzodiazepine binding site ligands with selectivity for individual GABAA receptor subtypes  as defined by the benzodiazepine-binding a subunit  may have fewer side effects and may even be effective in diseases  such as schizophrenia  autism or chronic pain  that do not respond well to classical benzodiazepines. The distributions of the individual a subunits across the CNS have been extensively characterized. However  as GABAA receptors may contain two different a subunits  the distribution of the subunits does not necessarily reflect the distribution of receptor subtypes with respect to benzodiazepine pharmacology. In the present study  we have used in vivo [(18)F]flumazenil PET and in vitro [(3)H]flumazenil autoradiography in combination with GABAA receptor point-mutated mice to characterize the distribution of the two most prevalent GABAA receptor subtypes (a1 and a2) throughout the mouse brain. The results were in agreement with published in vitro data. High levels of a2-containing receptors were found in brain regions of the neuronal network of anxiety. The a1/a2 subunit combinations were predictable from the individual subunit levels. In additional experiments  we explored in vivo [(18)F]flumazenil PET to determine the degree of receptor occupancy at GABAA receptor subtypes following oral administration of diazepam. The dose to occupy 50% of sensitive receptors  independent of the receptor subtype(s)  was 1-2mg/kg  in agreement with published data from ex vivo studies with wild type mice. In conclusion  we have resolved the quantitative distribution of a1- and a2-containing homomeric and mixed GABAA receptors in vivo at the millimeter scale and demonstrate that the regional drug receptor occupancy in vivo at these GABAA receptor subtypes can be determined by [(18)F]flumazenil PET. Such information should be valuable for drug development programs aiming for subtype-selective benzodiazepine site ligands for new therapeutic indications."

BTBR T (+) Itpr3 (tf) /J (BTBR)  an inbred mouse strain  displays social deficits and repetitive self-grooming  offering face validity to ASD diagnostic symptoms. Reduced GABAergic neurotransmission in BTBR suggests that GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) could improve ASD-relevant BTBR phenotypes. The neuroactive steroid ganaxolone acts as a PAM  displaying anticonvulsant properties in rodent epilepsy models and an anxiolytic-like profile in the elevated plus-maze.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated ganaxolone in BTBR and C57BL/6J mice in standardized assays for sociability and repetitive behaviors. Open field and anxiety-related behaviors were tested as internal controls and for comparison with the existing neuroactive steroid literature.RESULTS: Ganaxolone improved aspects of social approach and reciprocal social interactions in BTBR  with no effect on repetitive self-grooming  and no detrimental effects in C57BL/6J. Ganaxolone increased overall exploratory activity in BTBR and C57BL/6J in the open field  social approach  and elevated plus-maze  introducing a confound for the interpretation of social improvements. Allopregnanolone and diazepam similarly increased total entries in the elevated plus-maze  indicating that behavioral activation may be a general property of GABAA receptor PAMs in these strains.CONCLUSIONS: Ganaxolone shows promise for improving sociability. In addition  ganaxolone  as well as other GABAA receptor PAMs  enhanced overall BTBR activity. The translational implications of specific sociability improvements and nonspecific behavioral activation by ganaxolone in the BTBR model remain to be determined. Future studies to explore whether PAMs provide a novel profile with unique benefits for ASD treatment will be worthwhile."

Unfortunately  few methods exist to study visual perception in pre-clinical species.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to adapt a task of visual integration by proximity with relevance to schizophrenia to a rodent touchscreen environment to determine the effects of glutamatergic and GABAergic compounds. In this way  we could evaluate the effects of common models of cognitive impairment  as well as the effects of net excitation versus inhibition  on a task of visual integration.METHOD: Rats were trained to perform a visual discrimination where the stimuli were composed of rows of dots differing only in there horizontal and vertical proximity. Once stable performance had been achieved  animals were tested under the influence of glutamatergic or GABAergic drugs (ketamine  MK-801  PCP  memantine  chlordiazepoxide  or diazepam) while attempting to perform a visual discrimination with altered stimuli.RESULTS: Ketamine appeared to impair perceptual grouping in this paradigm  while the GABA agonist chlordiazepoxide enhanced grouping even in the presence of non-selective effects.CONCLUSIONS: In general  these findings support the theory that NMDA antagonists may disrupt visual grouping by proximity and highlight a potential beneficial effect of enhanced GABA activity in perception. However  additional research will be required to confirm the stimulus selectivity of this effect  and the clinical significance of this approach."

How the IC acquires its integrative properties remains unexplored. We compared the emergence of multisensory integration (MSI) in the IC of behaviorally distinct mouse strains. While adult C57BL/6 mice exhibited robust MSI  this capacity was impaired in the inbred BTBR T+tf/J mouse model of idiopathic autism. The deficit reflected weakened <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid (GABA) circuits and compromised postnatal pruning of cross-modal input. Transient pharmacological enhancement by diazepam in BTBR mice during an early sensitive period rescued inhibition and integration in the adult IC. Moreover  impaired MSI was common across three other monogenic models (GAD65  Shank3  and Mecp2 knockout mice) displaying behavioral phenotypes and parvalbumin-circuit abnormalities. Our findings offer developmental insight into a key neural circuit relevant to neuropsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia and autism."

In neurons  calcium sensing plays important roles in neuronal plasticity  neurotransmitter release  long-term synapse modification and ion channel activity. Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is a member of the highly conserved neuronal calcium sensor family. Although NCS-1 has been associated with psychiatric conditions including autism  bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  it is unclear which role NCS-1 plays in behavior. To understand the involvement of NCS-1 in psychiatric conditions  we provided a comprehensive behavioral characterization of NCS-1 knockout (KO) mice. These mice grow and develop normally without apparent abnormalities in comparison to wild type littermates. However  open field showed that NCS-1 deficiency impairs novelty-induced exploratory activity in both KO and heterozygote (HT) mice. Moreover  NCS-1-deficiency also resulted in anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors as demonstrated by elevated plus maze  large open field  forced swim and tail suspension tasks. Furthermore  based on spontaneous object recognition test  non-aversive long-term memory was impaired in NCS-1 KO mice. In contrast  neither social behavior nor a kind of aversive memory was affected under NCS-1 deficiency. These data implicate NCS-1 in exploratory activity  memory and mood-related behaviors  suggesting that NCS-1 gene ablation may result in phenotypic abnormalities associated with neuropsychiatric disorders."
"6","21741402","BTBR T+tf/J mice: autism-relevant behaviors and reduced fractone-associated heparan sulfate.","BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) mice have emerged as strong candidates to serve as models of a range of autism-relevant behaviors  showing deficiencies in social behaviors; reduced or unusual ultrasonic vocalizations in conspecific situations; and enhanced  repetitive self-grooming. Recent studies have described their behaviors in a seminatural visible burrow system (VBS); a Social Proximity Test in which avoidance of a conspecific is impossible; and in an object approach and investigation test evaluating attention to specific objects and potential stereotypies in the order of approaching/investigating objects. VBS results confirmed strong BTBR avoidance of conspecifics and in the Social Proximity Test  BTBR showed dramatic differences in several close-in behaviors  including specific avoidance of a nose-to-nose contact that may potentially be related to gaze-avoidance. Diazepam normalized social avoidance by BTBRs in a Three-Chamber Test  and some additional behaviors - but not nose to nose avoidance - in the Social Proximity Test. BTBR also showed higher levels of preference for particular objects  and higher levels of sequences investigating 3- or 4-objects in the same order. Heparan sulfate (HS) associated with fractal structures in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles was severely reduced in BTBR. HS may modulate the functions of a range of growth and guidance factors during development  and HS abnormalities are associated with relevant brain (callosal agenesis) and behavioral (reductions in sociality) changes; suggesting the value of examination of the dynamics of the HS system in the context of autism."
"7","21591401","[A case of Asperger's disorder with catatonia originally suspected of being catatonic schizophrenia].","We report the case of an adolescent male who presented with mutism  immobility  catalepsy  and mannerisms. The patient was admitted to our hospital with suspected catatonic schizophrenia; however  he was subsequently diagnosed with catatonia due to Asperger's disorder. The patient was a 16-year-old male. More than six months before presentation  his grandfather displayed bizarre and violent behavior. Subsequently  he began to experience catatonia  which eventually led to hospitalization. Treatment with diazepam improved his condition and  as no causal disorders other than Asperger's disorder were identified  he was diagnosed with catatonia. The patient had experienced persistent abuse by his mother during childhood; therefore  it is important to consider reactive attachment disorder (DSM-IV-TR) as a differential diagnosis. Among child and adolescent psychiatrists  catatonia is considered to occur at a high frequency among patients with autistic spectrum disorders. In contrast  general psychiatrists tend to consider catatonia as related to schizophrenia  which may be the reason why the diagnosis of our patient was difficult. We assume that the pathogenesis of catatonia in this case was death mimicry due to the subjective perception of a life-threatening situation. For the treatment of catatonia with autistic spectrum disorders  the efficacy of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy has been established. When a patient with an autistic spectrum disorder presents with motor functional disturbances  it is important to consider these disturbances as catatonia. Furthermore  it is also important to begin the treatment mentioned above even in the presence of definite psychogenic or situational factors."
"8","21055421","A novel social proximity test suggests patterns of social avoidance and gaze aversion-like behavior in BTBR T+ tf/J mice.","The BTBR T+ tf/J (BTBR) inbred mouse strain displays a low sociability phenotype relevant to the first diagnostic symptom of autism  deficits in reciprocal social interactions. Previous studies have shown that BTBR mice exhibit reduced social approach  juvenile play  and interactive behaviors. The present study evaluated the behavior of the BTBR and C57BL/6J (B6) strains in social proximity. Subjects were closely confined and tested in four experimental conditions: same strain male pairs (Experiment 1); different strain male pairs (Experiment 2); same strain male pairs and female pairs (Experiment 3); same strain male pairs treated with an anxiolytic (Experiment 4). Results showed that BTBR mice displayed decreased nose tip-to-nose tip  nose-to-head and upright behaviors and increased nose-to-anogenital  crawl under and crawl over behaviors. These results demonstrated avoidance of reciprocal frontal orientations in the BTBR  providing a parallel to gaze aversion  a fundamental predictor of autism. For comparative purposes  Experiment 3 assessed male and female mice in a three-chamber social approach test and in the social proximity test. Results from the three-chamber test showed that male B6 and female BTBR displayed a preference for the sex and strain matched conspecific stimulus  while female B6 and male BTBR did not. Although there was no significant interaction between sex and strain in the social proximity test  a significant main effect of sex indicated that female mice displayed higher levels of nose tip-to-nose tip contacts and lower levels of anogenital investigation (nose-to-anogenital) in comparison to male mice  all together suggesting different motivations for sociability in males and females. Systemic administration of the anxiolytic  diazepam  decreased the frequency of two behaviors associated with anxiety and defensiveness  upright and jump escape  as well as crawl under behavior. This result suggests that crawl under behavior  observed at high levels in BTBR mice  is elicited by the aversiveness of social proximity  and possibly serves to avoid reciprocal frontal orientations with other mice."
"9","20816701","General and social anxiety in the BTBR T+ tf/J mouse strain.","BTBR T+ tf/J (BTBR) is an inbred mouse strain that shows behavioral traits with analogies to the three diagnostic symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD); deficits in social interaction  impaired communication  and repetitive behaviors with restricted interests. Previous findings reveal that when compared to C57BL/6J (B6) and other inbred strains  BTBR exhibit normal to low anxiety-like traits in paradigms designed to assess anxiety-related behaviors. The current study assessed the generality of these anxiety findings. In experiment 1  B6 and BTBR mice were tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM)  mouse defense test battery (MDTB) and elevated zero-maze. BTBR mice exhibited an anxiogenic profile in the EPM  with a reduction in open arm time and an increase in risk assessment behaviors  as compared to B6. In the MDTB  BTBR showed enhanced vocalization to the predator  and significantly less locomotor activity than B6 in the pre-threat situation  but significantly more locomotion than B6 following exposure to a predator threat  suggesting enhanced defensiveness to the predator. In the zero-maze  BTBR mice showed a significantly higher number of entries and time spent in the open segments of the apparatus  when compared to B6. In experiment 2  a three-chambered social preference test was used to evaluate effects of the systemic administration of an anxiolytic compound  diazepam  on B6 and BTBR social approach. Diazepam consistently increased time in the compartment containing the social stimulus  for both B6 and BTBR mice. However  in the vehicle treated groups  B6 mice spent significantly more time while BTBR mice spent significantly less time in the social stimulus compartment; after diazepam administration both B6 and BTBR strains significantly preferred the social stimulus chamber. These results suggest that while the anxiety responses of BTBR mice to novel situations (EPM and zero-maze) are inconsistent  BTBR mice appear to be more defensive to animate threat stimuli (predator or another mouse). Reduction of anxiety by diazepam normalized the social preference of BTBR for a mouse stimulus in the three-chambered test."
"10","19527754","Scopolamine-induced deficits in social memory in mice: reversal by donepezil.","Deficits in social behaviour is a characteristic of numerous mental disorders including autism  schizophrenia  depression and Alzheimer's disease. For the assessment of pharmacological and genetic experimental disease models  conventional social interaction tasks bear the uncertainty that any drug-induced abnormality of the investigator may feed back to the drug-free companion modifying its reactions. A considerable technical improvement was recently reported by Moy et al. [Moy SS  Nadler JJ  Perez A  Barbaro RP  Johns JM  Magnuson T  et al. Sociability and preference for social novelty in five inbred strains: an approach to assess autistic-like behaviours in mice. Genes Brain Behav 2004;3:287-302] in which the drug free partner is confined to a small cage and social contacts of the investigator are recorded uncontaminated of any social reactions of the stranger. Using this novel behavioural paradigm  we here show in C57Bl/6 female mice that sociability (social interaction with a stranger mouse) is not impaired after administration of the anxiolytic diazepam (0.1-1 mg/kg) or the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine hydrobromide (0.1-1 mg/kg). However  social memory tested after a short time interval was impaired by both drugs in a dose-dependent manner (diazepam: &gt; or = 0.5mg/kg; scopolamine: &gt; or = 0.3mg/kg). The scopolamine-induced short-term memory deficit was reversed to normal by the choline esterase inhibitor donepezil (1 mg/kg). Given this dependence of social recognition on the cholinergic system  combined with the clinical observation of reduced social contacts in dementia patients  sociability may offer a novel endpoint biomarker with translational value in experimental models of cognitive dysfunction."
"11","16173223","Comparison of the effectiveness of oral diazepam and midazolam for the sedation of autistic patients during dental treatment.","PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to compare the effectiveness of oral diazepam and midazolam in sedating autistic patients during dental treatment.METHODS: The treatment regimen consisted of nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalation in conjunction with oral administration of either diazepam 0.3 mg/kg or midazolam 0.5 mg/kg in a cross-over design study of 13 subjects aged 5.8 to 14.7 years. A drug was classified as being effective when over 70% of the patients taking the drug were judged as &quot;success&quot; in all 3 behavioral criteria: (1) sleeping; (2) body movement; and (3) crying behaviors. The study was observed by an independent clinician with an intraexaminer reliability of 88%.RESULTS: For sleeping behavior  midazolam was found to be significantly more effective than diazepam as the duration of stimulation increased (P&lt;.05). For the movement and crying behaviors  midazolam also proved to be significantly more effective from the start of treatment through the 35- and 40-min markers  respectively (P&lt;.05). For the remainder of treatment  however  there was no statistically significant difference in these behaviors between the trials (P&gt;.05). Diazepam and midazolam were rated as 77% and 100% successful  according to the overall behavior evaluation criteria (P=.02).CONCLUSIONS: Both diazepam and midazolam were shown to be effective sedative agents  successfully and safely used to sedate autistic patients for dental treatment. Midazolam was significantly more effective than diazepam in those portions of the procedure with increased stimulation."
