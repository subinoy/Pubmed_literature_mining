It is estimated more than 60/100 000 children are suffering from PDD. Comorbid disorders are common in people with PDD  including intellectual deficiency  symptoms of attention deficit-hyperactivity  aggression and disruption  and pervasive repetitive behaviours or thoughts. These symptoms have a negative impact on the outcome and quality of life of the patients and their caregivers. The first-line management of comorbid disorders in PDD is behavioural intervention  but sometimes this is not sufficient  and the use of pharmacological treatment is needed.METHOD: We conducted a review of studies of medical treatments used in patients with PDD to establish which treatments show good evidence of efficacy in PDD. We used the Medline database and the following keywords &quot;pervasive development disorders&quot; or &quot;autism spectrum disorders&quot; or &quot;autistic disorder&quot; and &quot;therapy&quot; or &quot;treatment&quot;.RESULTS: The treatments that showed the best efficacy on irritability in well-designed studies are second generation antipsychotics  risperidone and aripiprazole. Some studies indicate that haloperidol is efficient as well  but the very high frequency of extra-pyramidal effects limits its use. Methylphenidate has shown some efficacy on impulsivity and hyperactivity in randomised placebo-controlled studies. First data concerning atomoxetine are promising but better-designed studies are needed. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors: fluvoxamine and fluoxetine have shown some efficacy in the treatment of serious and pervasive repetitive behaviours. Alpha-adrenergic treatments  clonidine and guanfacine  can help in the management of disruptive behaviours in patients with PDD. Data concerning naltrexone are contradictory  indeed many case reports of its efficacy on aggressive (mostly auto-aggressive) behaviours are reported in the literature  but well-designed studies do not find any improvement in patients treated with naltrexone compared with patients treated with placebo. First data concerning ocytocin are promising  indeed  if they were to be confirmed  that would be the first treatment efficient on the core symptoms of PDD."

In some individuals serotonin reuptake inhibitors  which decrease pre-synaptic re-uptake of serotonin  can ameliorate symptoms  as can resperidone  which blocks both dopamine and serotonin receptors. Loss of maternal UBE3A expression causes AS  while maternal duplications of chromosome 15q11.2-q13 that include the UBE3A gene cause ASD  implicating the maternally expressed UBE3A gene in the ASD phenotype. In a Drosophila screen for proteins regulated by UBE3A  we identified a key regulator of monoamine synthesis  the gene Punch  or GCH1  encoding the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase I. Here we show that Dube3a  the fly UBE3A orthologue  regulates Punch/GCH1 in the fly brain. Over-expression of Dube3a elevates tetrahydrobiopterin (THB)  the rate-limiting cofactor in monoamine synthesis while loss of Dube3a has the opposite effect. The fluctuations in dopamine levels were associated with hyper- and hypoactivity  respectively  in flies. We show that changes in Punch/GCH1 and dopamine levels do not depend on the ubiquitin ligase catalytic domain of Dube3a. In addition  both wild type Dube3a and a ubiquitination-defective Dube3a-C/A form were found at high levels in nuclear fractions and appear to be poly-ubiquitinated in vivo by endogenous Dube3a. We propose that the transcriptional co-activation function of Dube3a may regulate GCH1 activity in the brain. These results provide a connection between monoamine synthesis (dopamine/serotonin) and Dube3a expression that may explain why some individuals with ASD or AS respond better to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors than others."

Empiric evidence of efficacy of risperidone  methylphenidate and some selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors for maladaptive behaviors commonly associated with autism spectrum disorders has increased substantially in recent years. Preliminary controlled trials of valproate  atomoxetine  alpha-2 adrenergic agonists and olanzapine are promising. In addition to traditional psychotropic medications  investigators have examined the potential role of a variety of agents with glutamatergic or cholinergic mechanisms  and the results warrant further investigation. Although psychotropic medications are effective in treating some important associated behaviors  evidence of significant impact on the core features of autism spectrum disorders is very limited."

To create better treatment  we studied here clinical adverse effects of fluvoxamine and correlated them with genetic polymorphism of two genes  the promoter region of serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and serotonin 2A receptor gene (5-HT2AR). Twenty-eight subjects  consisting of 23 boys and 5 girls  aged from 3 to 18 years old diagnosed as having autistic disorder were analyzed during fluvoxamine administration. The dosages and duration of fluvoxamine treatment are 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day and 2 weeks to 17 months (mean 7.9 months)  respectively. There were several clinical adverse effects such as sleep disturbance in 9 cases  climb up to high places in 8  gastrointestinal symptoms in 6  hyperactivities in 5  excitement in 4  general fatigability in 2 and urticaria in 1. Medication was discontinued in 2 patients with fatigability and 1 with sleep disturbance  diarrhea and poor appetite. There was no significant correlation between genetic polymorphism in 5-HTTLPR and the occurrence of clinical adverse effects of fluvoxamine. However hyperactivity was significantly more frequent in the subjects with 102T/102T polymorphism of 5-HT2AR  and patients with sleep disturbance were significantly less frequent in the subjects with 102C/102C polymorphism. We conclude that the clinical adverse effects such as climb up to high places and hyperactivity during fluvoxamine treatment may be relatively specific in children  and that genetic polymorphism of 5-HT2AR may be related to the appearance of clinical adverse effects."
