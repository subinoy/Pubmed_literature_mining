Serotonin (5-HT) and the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) have increasingly been shown to play important roles in both brain and intestinal development and long-term function. 5-HT and SERT may thus modulate critical functions in the development and perpetuation of brain-gut axis disease. We discuss the potential roles of 5-HT and SERT in the brain and intestinal manifestations of autism spectrum disorders and developmental antidepressant exposure. The potential therapeutic value of 5-HT4 modulation in the subsequent treatment of these conditions is also addressed."

Prenatal SSRI exposure has been associated with an increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)  and peripheral 5-HT is elevated in some ASD patients. Perinatal SSRI exposure in rodents has been associated with increased depression and anxiety-like behavior  decreased sociability  and impaired learning in the offspring  behaviors often seen in ASD. The present study investigated whether perinatal exposure to citalopram causes persistent neurobehavioral effects. Gravid Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to two groups and subcutaneously injected twice per day with citalopram (10mg/kg; Cit) or saline (Sal) 6h apart on embryonic day (E)6-21  and then drug was given directly to the pups after delivery from postnatal day (P)1-20. Starting on P60  one male/female from each litter was tested in the Cincinnati water maze (CWM) and open-field before and after MK-801. A second pair from each litter was tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) and open-field before and after (+)-amphetamine. A third pair was tested as follows: elevated zero-maze  open-field  marble burying  prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle  social preference  and forced swim. Cit-exposed rats were impaired in the MWM during acquisition and probe  but not during reversal  shift  or cued trials. Cit-exposed rats also showed increased marble burying  decreased time in the center of the open-field  decreased latency to immobility in forced swim  and increased acoustic startle across prepulse intensities with no effects on CWM. The results are consistent with citalopram inducing several ASD-like effects. The findings add to concerns about use of SSRIs during pregnancy. Further research on different classes of antidepressants  dose-effect relationships  timing of exposure periods  and mechanisms for these effects are needed. It is also important to balance the effects described here against the effects of the disorders for which the drugs are given."
"3","26221830","Affective communication in rodents: serotonin and its modulating role in ultrasonic vocalizations.","Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine  5-HT) is an important modulatory neurotransmitter and functions as a key neurodevelopmental signal in the mammalian brain. 5-HT plays a prominent role in regulating various types of psychological processes and functions  including mood and emotion  particularly anxiety  but also in regulating social behavior. Consequently  the 5-HT system is implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders  such as anxiety disorders and depression or autism spectrum disorders (ASD)  with selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors being the frontline medication. Mice and rats perceive and emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USV). It is widely believed that the various distinct USV types reflect the animal's affective state  such as anxiety or pleasure. Furthermore  they serve communicative functions  for instance  as alarm calls or social contact calls. Manipulations targeting the 5-HT system alter affective ultrasonic communication in rodents throughout life  probably because of its important role in regulating anxiety and social behavior. Ample evidence indicates the involvement of the 5-HT system in modulating isolation-induced USV in pups. Later in life  the 5-HT system plays a strong modulatory role in the emission of aversive 22-kHz USV in rats. So far  little is known about the role of 5-HT in the production of interaction-induced USV in mice and appetitive 50-kHz USV in rats  although recent findings also suggest a modulatory effect of the 5-HT system. Assessment of rodent USV is a valuable method to investigate mood and emotion  and to enhance our understanding of  and develop novel pharmacological therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders  such as anxiety disorders and depression or ASD."

He became bedridden  accompanied by sleep disturbance  sustained upward gaze  and generalized rigidity. Magnetic resonance imaging showed unremarkable findings  but antiglutamate receptor autoantibodies were positive in his cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment with thiamine infusion and steroid pulse therapy showed little effect  but gross motor dysfunction and appetite loss were ameliorated by the administration of l-DOPA and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Thereafter  autistic behaviors predominated  including loss of social interaction  oral tendency  water phobia  and aggressiveness. Initiation of donepezil  an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor  resulted in the disappearance of these symptoms and total recovery of the patient to his previous psychosocial levels. We hypothesize that the acute regression in adolescence represents a process closely related to the defects of serotonergic and cholinergic systems that are innate to DS brains and not just a nonspecific comorbidity of depression or limbic encephalitis."

The aim of this study was to explore the association of A2BP1 gene polymorphisms with antipsychotic induced weight gain (AIWG) in Chinese Han population. Three hundred and twenty-eight patients with schizophrenia were followed-up for an 8-week period of treatment with olanzapine. The fasting weights of 328 patients were measured before and after the 8-week course of treatment. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs8048076  rs1478697  rs10500331  and rs4786847) of the A2BP1 gene were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We analyzed putative association of A2BP1 polymorphisms with AIWG of olanzapine using linear regression analysis and found that SNP rs1478697 was significantly associated with AIWG caused by olanzapine (p=0.0012; Bonferroni corrected p=0.0048). The association was replicated in another independent sample including 208 first-episode and drug-naïve patients presenting with schizophrenia after a 4-week treatment with olanzapine (p=0.0092; Bonferroni corrected p=0.0368; meta p=5.33×10(-5)). To explore the biological plausibility of A2BP1 in the pathogenesis of AIWG  we made expression analyses and eQTL analyses; these analyses showed that A2BP1 was highly expressed in whole brain tissues using the HBT database  and that rs1478697 has an expression quantitative trait locus effect in human cerebellar cortex tissues using the BRAINEAC database (p=2.50E-04). In conclusion  the rs1478697 in A2BP1 may be associated with AIWG induced by 8-week treatment with olanzapine."
"6","26092083","Prenatal Antidepressant Exposure and Childhood Autism Spectrum Disorders: Cause for Concern?","There is empirical evidence for a role for serotonin in autism . In experimental animals  early life exposure to serotonergic antidepressants or maternal stress affects brain development  with subsequent changes in serotonin tone in adult animals. Recently  antidepressant exposure during pregnancy has been associated with autism in epidemiological studies. At least part of the association is potentially explained by maternal depression or factors associated with depression. Importantly  even if there is no causal relation between prenatal antidepressant exposure and autism  use of antidepressants during pregnancy is a marker of potential problems later in life across five independent study populations  and exposed children may need special attention regardless of the underlying mechanism. Future studies need to disentangle the effects of maternal depression and antidepressant use during pregnancy while adjusting for the postnatal environment. One promising strategy is to use results from basic science to guide the inclusion of potential biological intermediates in advanced epidemiological studies."
"7","26022075","Putative Microcircuit-Level Substrates for Attention Are Disrupted in Mouse Models of Autism.","BACKGROUND: Deep layer excitatory circuits in the prefrontal cortex represent the strongest locus for genetic convergence in autism  but specific abnormalities within these circuits that mediate key features of autism  such as cognitive or attentional deficits  remain unknown. Attention normally increases the sensitivity of neural populations to incoming signals by decorrelating ongoing cortical circuit activity. Here  we investigated whether mechanisms underlying this phenomenon might be disrupted within deep layer prefrontal circuits in mouse models of autism.METHODS: We isolated deep layer prefrontal circuits in brain slices then used single-photon GCaMP imaging to record activity from many (50 to 100) neurons simultaneously to study patterns of spontaneous activity generated by these circuits under normal conditions and in two etiologically distinct models of autism: mice exposed to valproic acid in utero and Fmr1 knockout mice.RESULTS: We found that modest doses of the cholinergic agonist carbachol normally decorrelate spontaneous activity generated by deep layer prefrontal networks. This effect was disrupted in both valproic acid-exposed and Fmr1 knockout mice but intact following other manipulations that did not model autism.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cholinergic modulation may contribute to attention by acting on local cortical microcircuits to decorrelate spontaneous activity. Furthermore  defects in this mechanism represent a microcircuit-level endophenotype that could link diverse genetic and developmental disruptions to attentional deficits in autism. Future studies could elucidate pathways leading from various etiologies to this circuit-level abnormality or use this abnormality itself as a target and identify novel therapeutic strategies that restore normal circuit function."
"8","26021727","Serotonin mediated immunoregulation and neural functions: Complicity in the aetiology of autism spectrum disorders.","Serotonergic system has long been implicated in the aetiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)  since platelet hyperserotonemia is consistently observed in a subset of autistic patients  who respond well to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Apart from being a neurotransmitter  serotonin functions as a neurotrophic factor directing brain development and as an immunoregulator modulating immune responses. Serotonin transporter (SERT) regulates serotonin level in lymphoid tissues to ensure its proper functioning in innate and adaptive responses. Immunological molecules such as cytokines in turn regulate the transcription and activity of SERT. Dysregulation of serotonergic system could trigger signalling cascades that affect normal neural-immune interactions culminating in neurodevelopmental and neural connectivity defects precipitating behavioural abnormalities  or the disease phenotypes. Therefore  we suggest that a better understanding of the cross talk between serotonergic genes  immune systems and serotonergic neurotransmission will open wider avenues to develop pharmacological leads for addressing the core ASD behavioural deficits."

We have previously shown that loss of GluD1 leads to social and cognitive deficits in mice  however  its role in synaptic development and neurotransmission remains poorly understood. Here we report that GluD1 is enriched in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and GluD1 knockout mice exhibit a higher dendritic spine number  greater excitatory neurotransmission as well as higher number of synapses in mPFC. In addition abnormalities in the LIMK1-cofilin signaling  which regulates spine dynamics  and a lower ratio of GluN2A/GluN2B expression was observed in the mPFC in GluD1 knockout mice. Analysis of the GluD1 knockout CA1 hippocampus similarly indicated the presence of higher spine number and synapses and altered LIMK1-cofilin signaling. We found that systemic administration of an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor partial agonist d-cycloserine (DCS) at a high-dose  but not at a low-dose  and a GluN2B-selective inhibitor Ro-25-6981 partially normalized the abnormalities in LIMK1-cofilin signaling and reduced excess spine number in mPFC and hippocampus. The molecular effects of high-dose DCS and GluN2B inhibitor correlated with their ability to reduce the higher stereotyped behavior and depression-like behavior in GluD1 knockout mice. Together these findings demonstrate a critical requirement for GluD1 in normal spine development in the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover  these results identify inhibition of GluN2B-containing receptors as a mechanism for reducing excess dendritic spines and stereotyped behavior which may have therapeutic value in certain neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism."

"11","25646455","Behavioral training reverses global cortical network dysfunction induced by perinatal antidepressant exposure.","Abnormal cortical circuitry and function as well as distortions in the modulatory neurological processes controlling cortical plasticity have been argued to underlie the origin of autism. Here  we chemically distorted those processes using an antidepressant drug-exposure model to generate developmental neurological distortions like those characteristics expressed in autism  and then intensively trained altered young rodents to evaluate the potential for neuroplasticity-driven renormalization. We found that young rats that were injected s.c. with the antidepressant citalopram from postnatal d 1-10 displayed impaired neuronal repetition-rate following capacity in the primary auditory cortex (A1). With a focus on recovering grossly degraded auditory system processing in this model  we showed that targeted temporal processing deficits induced by early-life antidepressant exposure within the A1 were almost completely reversed through implementation of a simple behavioral training strategy (i.e.  a modified go/no-go repetition-rate discrimination task). Degraded parvalbumin inhibitory GABAergic neurons and the fast inhibitory actions that they control were also renormalized by training. Importantly  antidepressant-induced degradation of serotonergic and dopaminergic neuromodulatory systems regulating cortical neuroplasticity was sharply reversed. These findings bear important implications for neuroplasticity-based therapeutics in autistic patients."

Serotonin agonists modulate motor response inhibition and have shown positive behavioural effects in both disorders.AIMS: We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the so far unknown shared and disorder-specific inhibitory brain dysfunctions in these two disorders  as well as the effects of a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine.METHODS: Age-matched boys with ADHD (18)  ASD (19) and healthy controls (25) were compared with fMRI during a stop task measuring motor inhibition. Patients were scanned twice  under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind  placebo-controlled randomised design. Repeated measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. To test for potential normalisation effects of brain dysfunctions  patients under each drug condition were compared to controls.RESULTS: Under placebo  relative to controls  ASD boys showed overactivation in left and right inferior frontal cortex (IFC)  while ADHD boys showed disorder-specific underactivation in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basal ganglia. Under fluoxetine  the prefrontal dysfunctions were no longer observed  due to inverse effects of fluoxetine on these activations: fluoxetine downregulated IFC and OFC activation in ASD but upregulated them in ADHD.CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that fluoxetine normalises frontal lobe dysfunctions in both disorders via inverse effects  downregulating abnormally increased frontal activation in ASD and upregulating abnormally decreased frontal activation in ADHD  potentially reflecting inverse baseline serotonin levels in both disorders."
"13","25382136","Exposure to serotonin adversely affects oligodendrocyte development and myelination in vitro.","Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine  5-HT) has been implicated to play critical roles in early neural development. Recent reports have suggested that perinatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) resulted in cortical network miswiring  abnormal social behavior  callosal myelin malformation  as well as oligodendrocyte (OL) pathology in rats. To gain further insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SSRIs-induced OL and myelin abnormalities  we investigated the effect of 5-HT exposure on OL development  cell death  and myelination in cell culture models. First  we showed that 5-HT receptor 1A and 2A subtypes were expressed in OL lineages  using immunocytochemistry  Western blot  as well as intracellular Ca(2+) measurement. We then assessed the effect of serotonin exposure on the lineage development  expression of myelin proteins  cell death  and myelination  in purified OL and neuron-OL myelination cultures. For pure OL cultures  our results showed that 5-HT exposure led to disturbance of OL development  as indicated by aberrant process outgrowth and reduced myelin proteins expression. At higher doses  such exposure triggered a development-dependent cell death  as immature OLs exhibited increasing susceptibility to 5-HT treatment compared to OL progenitor cells (OPC). We showed further that 5-HT-induced immature OL death was mediated at least partially via 5-HT2A receptor  since cell death could be mimicked by 5-HT2A receptor agonist 1-(2 5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride  (±)-2 5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride  but atten-uated by pre-treatment with 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ritanserin. Utilizing a neuron-OL myelination co-culture model  our data showed that 5-HT exposure significantly reduced the number of myelinated internodes. In contrast to cell injury observed in pure OL cultures  5-HT exposure did not lead to OL death or reduced OL density in neuron-OL co-cultures. However  abnormal patterns of contactin-associated protein (Caspr) clustering were observed at the sites of Node of Ranvier  suggesting that 5-HT exposure may affect other axon-derived factors for myelination. In summary  this is the first study to demonstrate that manipulation of serotonin levels affects OL development and myelination  which may contribute to altered neural connectivity noted in SSRIs-treated animals. The current in vitro study demonstrated that exposure to high level of serotonin (5-HT) led to aberrant oligodendrocyte (OL) development  cell injury  and myelination deficit. We propose that elevated extracellular serotonin levels in the fetal brain  such as upon the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy  may adversely affect OL development and/or myelination  thus contributing to altered neural connectivity seen in Autism Spectrum Disorders.

Serotonin agonists modulate WM and there is evidence of positive behavioural effects in both disorders. We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate shared and disorder-specific brain dysfunctions of WM in these disorders  and the effects of a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine.METHOD: Age-matched boys with ADHD (n = 17)  ASD (n = 17) and controls (n = 22) were compared using fMRI during an N-back WM task. Patients were scanned twice  under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind  placebo-controlled randomized design. Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects on performance and brain function. To test for normalization effects of brain dysfunctions  patients under each drug condition were compared to controls.RESULTS: Under placebo  relative to controls  both ADHD and ASD boys shared underactivation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fluoxetine significantly normalized the DLPFC underactivation in ASD relative to controls whereas it increased posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) deactivation in ADHD relative to control boys. Within-patient analyses showed inverse effects of fluoxetine on PCC deactivation  which it enhanced in ADHD and decreased in ASD.CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that fluoxetine modulates brain activation during WM in a disorder-specific manner by normalizing task-positive DLPFC dysfunction in ASD boys and enhancing task-negative default mode network (DMN) deactivation in ADHD."

However  two case-control studies suggested an association between prenatal SSRI exposure with childhood autism.AIMS: To prospectively determine whether intra-uterine SSSRI exposure is associated with childhood autistic symptoms in a population-based study.METHOD: A total of 376 children prenatally exposed to maternal depressive symptoms (no SSRI exposure)  69 children prenatally exposed to SSRIs and 5531 unexposed children were included. Child pervasive developmental and affective problems were assessed by parental report with the Child Behavior Checklist at ages 1.5  3 and 6. At age 6  we assessed autistic traits using the Social Responsiveness Scale (n = 4264).RESULTS: Prenatal exposure to maternal depressive symptoms without SSRIs was related to both pervasive developmental (odds ratio (OR) = 1.44  95% CI 1.07-1.93) and affective problems (OR = 1.44  95% CI 1.15-1.81). Compared with unexposed children  those prenatally exposed to SSRIs also were at higher risk for developing pervasive developmental problems (OR = 1.91  95% CI 1.13-3.47)  but not for affective problems. Children prenatally exposed to SSRIs also had more autistic traits (B = 0.15  95% CI 0.08-0.22) compared with those exposed to depressive symptoms only.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an association between prenatal SSRI exposure and autistic traits in children. Prenatal depressive symptoms without SSRI use were also associated with autistic traits  albeit this was weaker and less specific. Long-term drug safety trials are needed before evidence-based recommendations are possible."

The disease is primarily caused by the loss of function of maternally inherited UBE3A. Ube3a maternal-deficient mice recapitulates many essential feature of AS. These AS mice have been shown to be under chronic stress and exhibits anxiety-like behaviour because of defective glucocorticoid receptor signalling. Here  we demonstrate that chronic stress in these mice could lead to down-regulation of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala from early post-natal days. Down-regulation of parvalbumin-positive interneurons number could be because of decrease in the expression of parvalbumin in these neurons. We also find that treatment with fluoxetine  a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  results in restoration of impaired glucocorticoid signalling  elevated serum corticosterone level  parvalbumin-positive interneurons and anxiety-like behaviours. Our findings suggest that impaired glucocorticod signalling in hippocampus and amygdala of AS mice is critical for the decrease in parvalbumin interneurons number  emergence of anxiety and other behavioural deficits and highlights the importance of fluoxetine in the recovery of these abnormalities."
"17","24451919","Inverse Effect of Fluoxetine on Medial Prefrontal Cortex Activation During Reward Reversal in ADHD and Autism.","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) share brain function abnormalities during cognitive flexibility. Serotonin is involved in both disorders  and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can modulate cognitive flexibility and improve behavior in both disorders. Thus  this study investigates shared and disorder-specific brain dysfunctions in these 2 disorders during reward reversal  and the acute effects of an SSRI on these. Age-matched boys with ADHD (15)  ASD (18)  and controls (21) were compared with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a reversal task. Patients were scanned twice  under either an acute dose of Fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind  placebo-controlled randomized design. Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. Patients under each drug condition were compared with controls to assess normalization effects. fMRI data showed that  under placebo  ASD boys underactivated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)  compared with control and ADHD boys. Both patient groups shared decreased precuneus activation. Under Fluoxetine  mPFC activation was up-regulated and normalized in ASD boys relative to controls  but down-regulated in ADHD boys relative to placebo  which was concomitant with worse task performance in ADHD. Fluoxetine therefore has inverse effects on mPFC activation in ASD and ADHD during reversal learning  suggesting dissociated underlying serotonin abnormalities."
"18","24359174","Plasma oxytocin changes and anti-obsessive response during serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment: a placebo controlled study.","BACKGROUND: The drug treatments of choice for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). However  a correlation between the neuropeptide oxytocin in cerebrospinal fluid and the severity of OCD has previously been shown  and oxytocin and serotonin are interconnected within the brain. Few studies have investigated whether SRIs have any effect on oxytocin; thus  our aim was to explore the possibility that oxytocinergic mechanisms contribute to the anti-obsessive effect of SRIs.METHOD: In a randomized  double-blind trial  comparing SRIs (clomipramine and paroxetine) with placebo in 36 adults with OCD (characterized for subtypes)  plasma oxytocin was measured with radioimmunoassay after plasma extraction  at baseline  after 1 week  and after 4 weeks of treatment  and related to baseline severity and clinical response after 12 weeks  as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS).RESULTS: Baseline oxytocin levels correlated positively with baseline Y-BOCS ratings  but only among the future SRI responders. Patients with early onset of OCD had higher baseline oxytocin. During treatment  plasma oxytocin did not differ between SRI and placebo treatment. In SRI responders  plasma oxytocin first decreased and then increased; in non-responders (to SRI as well as to placebo)  the reverse was the case. After 4 weeks  treatment responders had attained higher oxytocin levels compared to non-responders. The intra-individual range (i.e.  the variability) of plasma oxytocin between measurements was the measure that best differentiated responders from non-responders. This range was higher in responders than non-responders  and lower in patients with autistic traits.CONCLUSIONS: SRIs have highly variable effects on plasma oxytocin between individuals. The associations between baseline oxytocin and OCD severity and between oxytocin changes and treatment response support the notions that oxytocin is involved in OCD pathophysiology  and that the anti-obsessive effects of SRIs are partly exerted through oxytocinergic mechanisms."
"19","24083985","Serotonin transporter and integrin beta 3 genes interact to modulate serotonin uptake in mouse brain.","Dysfunctions in serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine  5-HT) systems have been associated with several psychiatric illnesses  including anxiety  depression  obsessive-compulsive disorders and autism spectrum disorders. Convergent evidence from genetic analyses of human subjects has implicated the integrin ß3 subunit gene (ITGB3) as a modulator of serotonergic systems via genetic interactions with the 5-HT transporter gene (SLC6A4  SERT). While genetic interactions may result from contributions of each gene at several levels  we hypothesize that ITGB3 modulates the 5-HT system at the level of the synapse  through the actions of integrin avß3. Here we utilized a genetic approach in mouse models to examine Itgb3 contributions to SERT function both in the context of normal and reduced SERT expression. As integrin avß3 is expressed in postsynaptic membranes  we isolated synaptoneurosomes  which maintain intact pre- and post-synaptic associations. Citalopram binding revealed significant Slc6a4-driven reductions in SERT expression in midbrain synapses  whereas no significant changes were observed in hippocampal or cortical projections. Expecting corresponding changes to SERT function  we also measured 5-HT uptake activity in synaptoneurosomal preparations. Itgb3 single heterozygous mice displayed significant reductions in 5-HT Vmax  with no changes in Km  in midbrain preparations. However  in the presence of both Itgb3 and Slc6a4 heterozygozity  5-HT uptake was similar to wild-type levels  revealing a significant Slc6a4 by Itgb3 genetic interaction in the midbrain. Similar findings were observed in cortical preparations  whereas in the hippocampus  most Vmax changes were driven solely by Slc6a4. Our findings provide evidence that integrin avß3 is involved in the regulation of serotonergic systems in some  but not all 5-HT synapses  revealing novel contributions to synaptic specificity within the central nervous system."
"20","23917518","The BOLD signal and neurovascular coupling in autism.","BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) is commonly used to study differences in neuronal activity between human populations. As the BOLD response is an indirect measure of neuronal activity  meaningful interpretation of differences in BOLD responses between groups relies upon a stable relationship existing between neuronal activity and the BOLD response across these groups. However  this relationship can be altered by changes in neurovascular coupling or energy consumption  which would lead to problems in identifying differences in neuronal activity. In this review  we focus on fMRI studies of people with autism  and comparisons that are made of their BOLD responses with those of control groups. We examine neurophysiological differences in autism that may alter neurovascular coupling or energy use  discuss recent studies that have used fMRI to identify differences between participants with autism and control participants  and explore experimental approaches that could help attribute between-group differences in BOLD signals to either neuronal or neurovascular factors."
"21","23894004","Reduced serotonin receptor subtypes in a limbic and a neocortical region in autism.","Autism is a behaviorally defined  neurological disorder with symptom onset before the age of 3. Abnormalities in social-emotional behaviors are a core deficit in autism  and are characterized by impaired reciprocal-social interaction  lack of facial expressions  and the inability to recognize familiar faces. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and fusiform gyrus (FG) are two regions within an extensive limbic-cortical network that contribute to social-emotional behaviors. Evidence indicates that changes in brains of individuals with autism begin prenatally. Serotonin (5-HT) is one of the earliest expressed neurotransmitters  and plays an important role in synaptogenesis  neurite outgrowth  and neuronal migration. Abnormalities in 5-HT systems have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders  including autism  as evidenced by immunology  imaging  genetics  pharmacotherapy  and neuropathology. Although information is known regarding peripheral 5-HT in autism  there is emerging evidence that 5-HT systems in the central nervous system  including various 5-HT receptor subtypes and transporters  are affected in autism. The present study demonstrated significant reductions in 5-HT1A receptor-binding density in superficial and deep layers of the PCC and FG  and in the density of 5-HT(2A) receptors in superficial layers of the PCC and FG. A significant reduction in the density of serotonin transporters (5-HTT) was also found in the deep layers of the FG  but normal levels were demonstrated in both layers of the PCC and superficial layers of the FG. This study provides potential substrates for decreased 5-HT modulation/innervation in the autism brain  and implicate two 5-HT receptor subtypes as potential neuromarkers for novel or existing pharmacotherapies."

The serotonergic system is one of the earliest to develop during embryogenesis and early changes in serotonin levels can have large consequences for the correct development of specific brain areas. The regulation and functioning of serotonin is influenced by genetic risk factors  such as the serotonin transporter polymorphism in humans. This polymorphism is associated with anxiety-related symptoms  changes in social behavior  and cortical gray and white matter changes also seen in patients suffering from autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The human polymorphism can be mimicked by the knockout of the serotonin transporter in rodents  which are as a model system therefore vital to explore the precise neurobiological mechanisms. Moreover  there are pharmacological challenges influencing serotonin in early life  like prenatal/neonatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in depressed pregnant women. There is accumulating evidence that this dysregulation of serotonin during critical phases of brain development can lead to ASD-related symptoms in children  and reduced social behavior and increased anxiety in rodents. Furthermore  prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure  a mood stabilizing drug which is also thought to interfere with serotonin levels  has the potency to induce ASD-like symptoms and to affect the development of the serotonergic system. Here  we review and compare the neurodevelopmental and behavioral consequences of serotonin transporter gene variation  and prenatal SSRI and VPA exposure in the context of ASD."

Since the serotonergic raphe nuclear complex projects to the olfactory bulb (OB) and perinatal 5HT disruption has been shown to disrupt olfactory behaviors  the goal of this study was to further investigate such developmental effects in the OB of CTM exposed animals. Male and female rat pups were exposed to CTM from postnatal day 8-21. After animals reach adulthood (&gt;90 days)  OB tissue sections were processed immunohistochemically for SERT antiserum. Our data revealed that the density of the SERT immunoreactive fibers decreased ~40% in the OB of CTM exposed male rats  but not female rats. Our findings support a broad and long-lasting change throughout most of the 5HT system  including the OB  after early manipulation of 5HT. Because dysfunction of the early 5HT system has been implicated in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)  these new findings may offer insight into the abnormal olfactory perception often noted in patients with ASD."
"24","23495208","Serotonin hypothesis of autism: implications for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use during pregnancy.","Serotonin  a neurotransmitter found throughout the brain and body  has long been of interest in autism. Repeated findings of elevated platelet serotonin levels in approximately one third of children with autism has led some to believe that dysfunctional serotonin signaling may be a causal mechanism for the disorder. Because serotonin is critical to fetal brain development  concerns have arisen regarding prenatal exposure to substances that manipulate serotonin levels  such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This review examines evidence regarding the serotonin system and autism spectrum disorders (ASD)  as well as what the literature has reported thus far on developmental effects of prenatal exposure to SSRIs. Possible mechanisms by which SSRIs could affect the fetus during pregnancy and clinical implications are also discussed. Though the majority of studies conducted in infants and children suggest prenatal exposure to SSRIs does not affect neurodevelopment  interpretation must be tempered given small sample sizes. The only published study that focused on prenatal SSRI exposure and ASD found an increased risk with exposure to SSRIs  especially during the first trimester. Obstacles that will be faced in future research are isolating medication effects from maternal depression and  given the infrequent occurrence of exposure and outcome  obtaining an adequate sample size. Whether serotonin is an etiologic factor in ASD  and what it points to as a marker for subgrouping  remains unclear. Understanding how the development of ASD might be affected by prenatal factors that influence serotonin levels  such as SSRIs  could identify modifiable targets for prevention."

At least one study has examined the effect of repeated citalopram administration on the serum and brain concentration of testosterone (T) and its metabolites and shown that citalopram increases serum T. Several in vitro studies also suggest that sex steroid can alter 5-HT homeostasis. While research efforts have demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing the most common of multiple gain-of-function 5-HT reuptake transporter (SERT) coding variants  SERT Ala56  previously identified in children with ASD  exhibit autistic-like behaviors  elevated p38 MAPK-dependent transporter phosphorylation  enhanced 5-HT clearance rates and hyperserotonemia  a few studies provide some evidence that 5-HT may alter gonadal steroidogenesis. T  17ß-estradiol and synthetic estrogens are known inhibitors of AKR1C21 (BRENDA  E.C. 1.1.1.209)  the epitestosterone (epiT) producing enzyme in rodents. EpiT is a naturally occurring steroid in mammals  including man. An analysis of the literature suggests that epiT may be the central mediator in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Over thirty years ago  it was shown that rat brain epiT production is higher in females than in males. A similar finding in humans could explain the sex differences in the incidence of autism and other brain disorders. Despite this  the role of epiT in brain development remains a long neglected area of research."

Although the mechanistic basis for the disorder is not yet known  genetic analyses have suggested a role for abnormal excitatory/inhibitory signaling systems in brain  including dysregulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. In mice  the constitutive knockdown of NMDA receptors leads to social deficits  repetitive behavior  and self-injurious responses that reflect aspects of the autism clinical profile. However  social phenotypes differ with age: mice with reduced NMDA-receptor function exhibit hypersociability in adolescence  but markedly deficient sociability in adulthood. The present studies determined whether acute disruption of NMDA neurotransmission leads to exaggerated social approach  similar to that observed with constitutive disruption  in adolescent C57BL/6J mice. The effects of MK-801  an NMDA receptor antagonist  were compared with amphetamine  a dopamine agonist  and fluoxetine  a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  on performance in a three-chamber choice task. Results showed that acute treatment with MK-801 led to social approach deficits at doses without effects on entry numbers. Amphetamine also decreased social preference  but increased number of entries at every dose. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) had selective effects on social novelty preference. Withdrawal from a chronic ethanol regimen decreased activity  but did not attenuate sociability. Low doses of MK-801 and amphetamine were also evaluated in a marble-burying assay for repetitive behavior. MK-801  at a dose that did not disrupt sociability or alter entries  led to a profound reduction in marble-burying. Overall  these findings demonstrate that moderate alteration of NMDA  dopamine  or serotonin function can attenuate social preference in wild type mice."
"28","22876270","A review of executive function deficits and pharmacological management in children and adolescents.","OBJECTIVE: To review both the functions and dysfunction of the executive system (ES) focusing on the extent of executive function (EF) deficits in most psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents and the possibility of such deficits acting as markers for pharmacological management.METHOD: A LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED USING MEDLINE  PSYCHINFO  CINAHL  PSYCHARTICLES AND PUBMED WITH THE FOLLOWING KEYWORDS: executive function or dysfunction  pediatric or children or adolescents  psychopharmacology  psychotropic medications  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  depression  obsessive compulsive disorder  anxiety disorders  bipolar disorder  schizophrenia  autism spectrum disorders (ASD)  fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Due to the limited amount of specific information obtained for some childhood disorders  the search was broadened to include relevant adult literature where information was extrapolated.RESULTS: Abundant literature was found on the nature of the ES and the executive dysfunctions in most psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents  but not so much on the use of medication. EF deficits were found to be more consistent in disorders such as ADHD  ASD and FASD than in the other disorders but were not specific enough for use as clinical markers for those disorders. For children with ADHD and ASD there was adequate information on the use of psychotropic medications and impact on some EF domains but information on the impact of medication on EF in the other disorders in children and adolescents was fairly limited. Medications acting on the dopaminergic system also showed positive effects on EF deficits and are commonly used in the treatment of EF disorders such as ADHD  ASD and FASD.CONCLUSION: Existing literature indicates that EF deficits underlie most psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. However  there are so many executive functions linked to so many activities and circuits in the brain that it is hard to quantify them in a particular disorder for use as specific markers for that disorder. The ES uses dopamine as its main neurotransmitter and this has implications for clinical management. Dopamine agonists (e.g. stimulants) and antagonists (e.g. neuroleptics) are medications that have direct impact on the ES and are commonly used to treat EF disorders in children and adolescents while serotonergic medications e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have not been very successful in treating such disorders. Identifying EF deficits early could be useful in guiding management including the use of medication in those disorders."

Identifying environmental triggers has been difficult due to poorly understood pathophysiology and subjective definitions of autism. The use of antidepressants by pregnant women has been associated with autism. These and other unmetabolized psychoactive pharmaceuticals (UPPs) have also been found in drinking water from surface sources  providing another possible exposure route and raising questions about human health consequences. Here  we examined gene expression patterns of fathead minnows treated with a mixture of three psychoactive pharmaceuticals (fluoxetine  venlafaxine &amp; carbamazepine) in dosages intended to be similar to the highest observed conservative estimates of environmental concentrations. We conducted microarray experiments examining brain tissue of fish exposed to individual pharmaceuticals and a mixture of all three. We used gene-class analysis to test for enrichment of gene sets involved with ten human neurological disorders. Only sets associated with idiopathic autism were unambiguously enriched. We found that UPPs induce autism-like gene expression patterns in fish. Our findings suggest a new potential trigger for idiopathic autism in genetically susceptible individuals involving an overlooked source of environmental contamination."
"30","22541665","Pharmacotherapy of autism spectrum disorders.","Although no pharmacological or behavioral therapy has currently proven effective for treating all core symptoms of autism  many dysfunctional behaviors may be treated pharmacologically. Drug treatments should always be part of a comprehensive management plan that includes behavioral and educational interventions  and should be focused on specific targets. Several classes of psychotropic medications have been used to decrease the wide range of &quot;maladaptive&quot; or &quot;interfering&quot; behaviors and associated medical problems that can interfere with relationships and physical health and hinder the implementation of various non-pharmacological interventions. Atypical neuroleptics have been shown to be useful in the treatment of behavioral symptoms in autism. Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder medications may be effective for counteracting the additional features of hyperactivity and short attention span. Antiepileptic drugs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have shown promising results  but there are no specific indications for them as of yet. With respect to potential drug targets  some clinical features are caused by a dysfunction in neurochemical signaling systems  and thus may improve with selective pharmacological interventions acting on specific abnormal neurobiological pathways. Recent animal studies can be useful models for understanding the common pathogenic pathways leading to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)  and have the potential to offer new biologically focused treatment options."

There are several drugs that treat the symptoms associated with autism including irritability  aggressiveness and hyperactivity. Current drug research is based on the ongoing genetic  animal model and neuropathologic research. Two areas in particular  the glutamate and oxytocin systems  provide exciting new avenues for drug discovery.AREAS COVERED: This review examines what approaches have been used for the drugs that are currently being used to treat people with ASD. For the most part  drugs that treat other neuropsychiatric disorders have been examined to treat the people with ASD  unfortunately with little effect on the core symptoms.EXPERT OPINION: Until recently  there was not a plethora of knowledge about the neurobiological substrates of social behavior  pragmatic language usage and repetitive and/or restricted behaviors. Therefore  drug discovery has used the tools available for other neuropsychiatric disorders. Now that more biological information is available  there are many avenues for research for drug targets for ASD."
"32","22090498","Perinatal citalopram exposure selectively increases locus ceruleus circuit function in male rats.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  such as citalopram (CTM)  have been widely prescribed for major depressive disorder  not only for adult populations  but also for children and pregnant mothers. Recent evidence suggests that chronic SSRI exposure in adults increases serotonin (5-HT) levels in the raphe system and decreases norepinephrine (NE) locus ceruleus (LC) neural activity  suggesting a robust opposing interaction between these two monoamines. In contrast  perinatal SSRI exposure induces a long-lasting downregulation of the 5-HT-raphe system  which is opposite to that seen with chronic adult treatment. Therefore  the goal of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that perinatal CTM exposure (20 mg/kg/d) from postnatal day 1 (PN1) to PN10 leads to hyperexcited NE-LC circuit function in adult rats (&gt;PN90). Our single-neuron LC electrophysiological data demonstrated an increase in spontaneous and stimulus-driven neural activity  including an increase in phasic bursts in CTM-exposed animals. In addition  we demonstrated a corresponding immunoreactive increase in the rate-limiting catalyzing catecholamine enzyme (tyrosine hydroxylase) within the LC and their neocortical target sites compared to saline controls. Moreover  these effects were only evident in male exposed rats  suggesting a sexual dimorphism in neural development after SSRI exposure. Together  these results indicate that administration of SSRIs during a sensitive period of brain development results in long-lasting alterations in NE-LC circuit function in adults and may be useful in understanding the etiology of pervasive developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder."
"33","22025710","Perinatal antidepressant exposure alters cortical network function in rodents.","Serotonin (5-HT) plays a key role in early brain development  and manipulation of 5-HT levels during this period can have lasting neurobiological and behavioral consequences. It is unclear how perinatal exposure to drugs  such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  impacts cortical neural network function and what mechanism(s) may elicit the disruption of normal neuronal connections/interactions. In this article  we report on cortical wiring organization after pre- and postnatal exposure to the SSRI citalopram. We show that manipulation of 5-HT during early development in both in vitro and in vivo models disturbs characteristic chemoarchitectural and electrophysiological brain features  including changes in raphe and callosal connections  sensory processing  and myelin sheath formation. Also  drug-exposed rat pups exhibit neophobia and disrupted juvenile play behavior. These findings indicate that 5-HT homeostasis is required for proper brain maturation and that fetal/infant exposure to SSRIs should be examined in humans  particularly those with developmental dysfunction  such as autism."

The present study was undertaken to correlate striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding and cerebrospinal fluid insulin-like growth factor-1 (CSF-IGF-1) with clinical response in autistic children (n=13  age 5-16 years) after a 6-month fluoxetine treatment. Good clinical responders (n=6) had a decrease (p=0.031) in DAT binding as assessed using single-photon emission computed tomography with [123I]-nor-ß-CIT  whereas poor responders had a trend to an increase. An increase in CSF-IGF-1 (p=0.003) was detected after the treatment period  but no correlation between the clinical response and CSF-IGF-1 was found. In conclusion  fluoxetine decreases DAT binding indicating alleviation of the hyperdopaminergic state and increases CSF-IGF-1 concentration  which may also have a neuroprotective effect against dopamine-induced neurotoxicity in autistic children."
"35","21443820","Brain illness and creativity: mechanisms and treatment risks.","Brain diseases and their treatment may help or hurt creativity in ways that shape quality of life. Increased creative drive is associated with bipolar disorder  depression  psychosis  temporal lobe epilepsy  frontotemporal dementia  Parkinson disease treatments  and autism. Creativity depends on goal-driven approach motivation from midbrain dopaminergic systems. Fear-driven avoidance motivation is of less aid to creativity. When serotonin and norepinephrine lower motivation and flexible behaviour  they can inhibit creativity. Hemispheric lateralization and frontotemporal connections must interact to create new ideas and conceptual schemes. The right brain and temporal lobe contribute skill in novelty detection  while the left brain and frontal lobe foster approach motivation and more easily generate new patterns of action from the novel perceptions. Genes and phenotypes that increase plasticity and creativity in tolerant environments with relaxed selection pressure may confer risk in rigorous environments. Few papers substantively address this important but fraught topic. Antidepressants (ADs) that inhibit fear-driven motivation  such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  sometimes inhibit goal-oriented motivation as well. ADs that boost goal-directed motivation  such as bupropion  may remediate this effect. Benzodiazepines and alcohol may be counterproductive. Although dopaminergic agonists sometimes stimulate creativity  their doing so may inappropriately disinhibit behaviour. Dopamine antagonists may suppress creative motivation; lithium and anticonvulsant mood stabilizers may do so less. Physical exercise and REM sleep may help creativity. Art therapy and psychotherapy are not well studied. Preserving creative motivation can help creativity and other aspects of well-being in all patients  not just artists or researchers."

However  approximately 30% of patients do not respond sufficiently to first-line antidepressant drug treatment and require alternative therapeutics. Genome-wide studies searching for SSRI response DNA biomarkers or studies of candidate serotonin-related genes so far have given inconclusive or contradictory results. Here  we present an alternative transcriptome-based genome-wide approach for searching antidepressant drug-response biomarkers by using drug-effect phenotypes in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs).MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: We screened 80 LCLs from healthy adult female individuals for growth inhibition by paroxetine. A total of 14 LCLs with reproducible high and low sensitivities to paroxetine (seven from each phenotypic group) were chosen for genome-wide expression profiling with commercial microarrays.RESULTS: The most notable genome-wide transcriptome difference between LCLs displaying high versus low paroxetine sensitivities was a 6.3-fold lower (p = 0.0000256) basal expression of CHL1  a gene coding for a neuronal cell adhesion protein implicated in correct thalamocortical circuitry  schizophrenia and autism. The microarray findings were confirmed by real-time PCR (36-fold lower CHL1 expression levels in the high paroxetine sensitivity group). Several additional genes implicated in synaptogenesis or in psychiatric disorders  including ARRB1  CCL5  DDX60  DDX60L  ENDOD1  ENPP2  FLT1  GABRA4  GAP43  MCTP2 and SPRY2  also differed by more than 1.5-fold and a p-value of less than 0.005 between the two paroxetine sensitivity groups  as confirmed by real-time PCR experiments.CONCLUSION: Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of in vitro phenotyped LCLs identified CHL1 and additional genes implicated in synaptogenesis and brain circuitry as putative SSRI response biomarkers.

In some individuals serotonin reuptake inhibitors  which decrease pre-synaptic re-uptake of serotonin  can ameliorate symptoms  as can resperidone  which blocks both dopamine and serotonin receptors. Loss of maternal UBE3A expression causes AS  while maternal duplications of chromosome 15q11.2-q13 that include the UBE3A gene cause ASD  implicating the maternally expressed UBE3A gene in the ASD phenotype. In a Drosophila screen for proteins regulated by UBE3A  we identified a key regulator of monoamine synthesis  the gene Punch  or GCH1  encoding the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase I. Here we show that Dube3a  the fly UBE3A orthologue  regulates Punch/GCH1 in the fly brain. Over-expression of Dube3a elevates tetrahydrobiopterin (THB)  the rate-limiting cofactor in monoamine synthesis while loss of Dube3a has the opposite effect. The fluctuations in dopamine levels were associated with hyper- and hypoactivity  respectively  in flies. We show that changes in Punch/GCH1 and dopamine levels do not depend on the ubiquitin ligase catalytic domain of Dube3a. In addition  both wild type Dube3a and a ubiquitination-defective Dube3a-C/A form were found at high levels in nuclear fractions and appear to be poly-ubiquitinated in vivo by endogenous Dube3a. We propose that the transcriptional co-activation function of Dube3a may regulate GCH1 activity in the brain. These results provide a connection between monoamine synthesis (dopamine/serotonin) and Dube3a expression that may explain why some individuals with ASD or AS respond better to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors than others."

Altered regulation of central serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission may underlie such behavioral deficits. To test this  we compared 5-HT transporter (SERT)  5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptor densities among BTBR and C57 strains. Autoradiographic [(3) H] cyanoimipramine (1 nM) binding to SERT was 20-30% lower throughout the adult BTBR brain as compared to C57BL/10J mice. In hippocampal membrane homogenates  [(3) H] citalopram maximal binding (B(max) ) to SERT was 95 ± 13 fmol/mg protein in BTBR and 171 ± 20 fmol/mg protein in C57BL/6J mice  and the BTBR dissociation constant (K(D) ) was 2.0 ± 0.3 nM versus 1.1 ± 0.2 in C57BL/6J mice. Hippocampal 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptor binding was similar among strains. However  8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [(35) S] GTP<U+03B3>S binding in the BTBR hippocampal CA(1) region was 28% higher  indicating elevated 5-HT(1A) capacity to activate G-proteins. In BTBR mice  the SERT blocker  fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) and the 5-HT(1A) receptor partial-agonist  buspirone (2 mg/kg) enhanced social interactions. The D(2) /5-HT(2) receptor antagonist  risperidone (0.1 mg/kg) reduced marble burying  but failed to improve sociability. Overall  altered SERT and/or 5-HT(1A) functionality in hippocampus could contribute to the relatively low sociability of BTBR mice."

Among the potential environmental factors  hyperserotonemia during pregnancy and its effect on brain development could be playing a role in this prevalence raise. In the rodent model developed by Whitaker-Azmitia and colleagues  hyperserotonemia during fetal development results in a dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis  affecting the amygdala as well as pro-social hormone oxytocin regulation. Dysfunction of the amygdala and abnormal oxytocin levels may underlie many clinical features of ASD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the most widely used class of antidepressants drugs  and they are not contraindicated during pregnancy. In this paper  we hypothesize that increased serotonemia during pregnancy  including due to SSRI intake  could be one of the causes of the raising prevalence in autism. If our hypothesis is confirmed  it will not only shed light on one of the possible reason for autism prevalence  but also offer new preventive and treatment options."

In this study  we examined the effect of long-term SI rearing after weaning on emotional behaviors and cognitive function in mice. Furthermore  the effects of methylphenidate (MPH)  clozapine (CLZ) and fluoxetine (FLX) on SI-induced behavioral changes were examined to measure the predictive validity of SI-reared mice as an animal model for these neuropsychiatric disorders. MPH improved SI-induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated-plus maze test  but had no effect on aggressive behavior. In contrast  CLZ ameliorated aggressive behavior  but not anxiety-like behavior in SI-reared mice. Repeated FLX treatment prevented SI-induced aggressive behavior and social interaction deficits. These findings suggest that SI-induced behavioral abnormality is a psychobehavioral complex relevant to various clinical symptoms observed in neuropsychiatric disorders and that SI-reared mice are a useful animal model to study the pathophysiology/pathogenesis of these diseases."

In this context  we present a rationale for utilizing pharmacologic treatments aimed at modifying key neurodevelopmental processes in young children with autism. Early treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is presented as a model for pharmacologic interventions because there is evidence in autistic children for reduced brain serotonin synthesis during periods of peak synaptogenesis; serotonin is known to enhance synapse refinement; and exploratory studies with these agents in autistic children exist. Additional hypothetical developmental interventions and relevant published clinical data are described.

The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is of special interest given the nature of the biological findings and the reported effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors of autistic symptoms. So far the genetics researches of the SLC6A4 gene have given conflicting results. The aim of study was to investigate the association between the SLC6A4 gene and autism in the Chinese Han population. The present study was conducted with the detection of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP(S)) located within the SLC6A4 gene by using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) analysis. We performed a family-based association study of these polymorphisms in 175 Chinese Han family trios. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) measurement (D') analysis showed the presence of LD between markers across the locus. No significant evidence of association was found at any of the markers detected by using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and haplotype analyses in all samples and male samples. Our findings suggest that it is unlikely that DNA variations in the SLC6A4 gene play a significant role in the genetic predisposition to autism in the Chinese Han population or that allelic heterogeneity at the SLC6A4 loci dilutes potential disease-allele association."
"46","15854594","Quantitative analysis of immunolabeling for serotonin and for glutamate transporters after administration of imipramine and citalopram.","Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine  5-HT) is an amine neurotransmitter derived from tryptophan and is important in brain systems regulating mood  emotional behavior  and sleep. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs are used to treat disorders such as depression  stress  eating disorders  autism  and schizophrenia. It is thought that these drugs act to prolong the action of 5-HT by blocking reuptake. This may lead to decreased 5-HT content in the nerve fibers themselves; however  this has not previously been directly demonstrated. We have studied the effects of administration of two drugs  imipramine and citalopram  on levels of 5-HT in nerve fibers in the murine brain. Quantitative analysis of the areal density of 5-HT fibers throughout the brain was performed using ImageJ software. While a high density of fibers was observed in mid- and hind-brain regions and areas such as thalamus and hypothalamus  densities were far lower in areas such as cortex  where SSRIs might be thought to exert their actions. As anticipated  imipramine and citalopram produced a decline in 5-HT levels in nerve fibers  but the result was not uniform. Areas such as inferior colliculus showed significant reduction whereas little  if any  change was observed in the adjacent superior colliculus. The reason for  and significance of  this regionality is unclear. It has been proposed that serotonin effects in the brain might be linked to changes in glutamatergic transmission. Extracellular glutamate levels are regulated primarily by glial glutamate transporters. Qualitative evaluation of glutamate transporter immunolabeling in cortex of control and drug-treated mice revealed no discernable difference in intensity of glutamate transporter immunoreactivity. These data suggest that changes in intracellular and extracellular levels of serotonin do not cause concomitant changes in astroglial glutamate transporter expression  and thus cannot represent a mechanism for the delayed efficacy of antidepressants when administered clinically."

Parallel investigations of SERT knockout mice have uncovered multiple phenotypes that identify SERT as a candidate gene for additional human disorders ranging from irritable bowel syndrome to obesity. Replicated studies have demonstrated that the SERT 5'-flanking region polymorphism SS genotype is associated with poorer therapeutic responses and more frequent serious side effects during treatment with antidepressant SERT antagonists  namely  the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs)."

Little is known about the age-related brain pharmacokinetics of SSRIs; there is a lack of data regarding optimal dosing of medications for children. The authors used fluorine magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((19)F MRS) to evaluate age effects on whole-brain concentrations of fluvoxamine and fluoxetine in children taking SSRIs.METHOD: Twenty-one pediatric subjects with diagnoses of autistic disorder or other pervasive developmental disorders  6-15 years old and stabilized with a consistent dose of fluvoxamine or fluoxetine  were recruited for the study; 16 successfully completed the imaging protocol. Whole-brain drug levels in this group were compared to similarly acquired data from 28 adults.RESULTS: A significant relationship between dose and brain drug concentration was observed for both drugs across the age range studied. Brain fluvoxamine concentration in the children was lower  consistent with a lower dose/body mass drug prescription; when brain concentration was adjusted for dose/mass  age effects were no longer significant. Brain fluoxetine concentration was similar between age groups; no significant age effects on brain fluoxetine drug levels remained after adjustment for dose/mass. Observations of brain fluoxetine bioavailability and elimination half-life also were similar between age groups.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that fluvoxamine or fluoxetine prescriptions adjusted for dose/mass are an acceptable treatment approach for medicating children with autistic disorder or other pervasive developmental disorders. It must be determined whether these findings can be generalized to other pediatric populations."
"50","11466160","Effect of fluoxetine on regional cerebral metabolism in autistic spectrum disorders: a pilot study.","The regional metabolic effects of fluoxetine were examined in patients with autism spectrum disorders. Six adult patients with DSM-IV and Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI) diagnoses of autism (n = 5) and Asperger's syndrome (n = 1)  entered a 16-wk placebo-controlled cross-over trial of fluoxetine. The patients received (18)F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography with co-registered magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and at the end of the period of fluoxetine administration. After treatment  the patients showed significant improvement on the scores of the Yale--Brown Obsessive--Compulsive Scale -- Obsessions subscale and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale; Clinical Global Impressions -- Autism scores showed 3 of the patients much improved and 3 unchanged. Relative metabolic rates were significantly higher in the right frontal lobe following fluoxetine  especially in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the orbitofrontal cortex. Patients with higher metabolic rates in the medial frontal region and anterior cingulate when unmedicated were more likely to respond favourably to fluoxetine. These results are consistent with those in depression indicating that higher cingulate gyrus metabolic rates at baseline predict SRI response."
"51","11140783","Medication treatment in subjects with autistic spectrum disorders.","Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder that is aetiologically and clinically heterogeneous. Twin and family genetic studies provide evidence for strong genetic components. An international consortium using an affected sib pair strategy has found a promising linkage to a region on chromosome 7. In 10-15 % of the cases autism is due to associated medical conditions that affect normal brain functioning. Post-mortem studies on small case series report cellular abnormalities in the limbic system and cerebellum. Between 10 and 20 % of subjects with autism have macrocephalia  which is in accordance with MRI findings of an increased total brain tissue volume and enlargement most prominent in the occipital and parietal lobes. The most robust and well-replicated neurobiological abnormality in autism is an elevation of whole blood serotonin found in over 30% of the patients. Pharmacological interventions with serotonin reuptake blockers or with atypical neuroleptics that block both dopamine (D2) and serotonin (5-HT2) receptors seem to offer clinical benefit and merit further study."
"52","11071017","Increased density of the platelet serotonin transporter in autism.","BACKGROUND: Various data have shown the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in autism. The presence of the 5-HT transporter in platelets  similar to the same structure located in presynaptic serotonergic neurons  has produced a series of studies aimed at assessing its functionality in this disorder  but the ensuing findings are quite controversial. For this reason  we investigated the 5-HT transporter by means of the specific binding of [3H]-Paroxetine ([3H]-Par)  which is currently considered the first-choice ligand for labeling it  in platelets of 20 autistic children and adolescents  as compared with healthy control subjects.METHODS: Twenty children and adolescents of both sexes suffering from autism according to DSM IV criteria were included in the study and compared with a similar group of healthy control subjects. Platelet membranes and the binding of [3H]-Par were carried out according to standardized protocols.RESULTS: The results showed a significantly higher density of [3H]-Par binding sites in autistic children than in healthy control subjects.CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the presence of a serotonergic dysfunction in autism and would suggest that the 5-HT transporter may have a specific role in this disorder  also in the light of its recently proposed role in brain development."
"53","10986804","Pervasive developmental disorders: a 10-year review.","OBJECTIVE: To summarize recent advances about the nature  diagnosis  and treatment of pervasive developmental disorders.METHOD: Review of Medline databases  books  and book chapters published between July 1989 and November 1999.RESULTS: Clinical and genetic studies support expansion of the concept of autism to include a broader spectrum of social communication handicaps. The prevalence of autism is approximately 1 per 2 000; the prevalence of autism and Asperger's disorder together is 1 per 1 000. The Checklist for Autism in Toddlers is a useful screening instrument for 18-month-old children; the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule are instruments of choice for research. Although twin and family studies clearly support genetic factors as important in autism  linkage analysis studies indicate that many genes may be involved. There is no one treatment of choice. Social-pragmatic approaches  augmented by individualized strategies and social coaching  may be best for teaching social communication skills. Pharmacological interventions have a limited role in improving social communication  but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical neuroleptic medications may help ameliorate aggression  hyperactivity  and other secondary problems.CONCLUSIONS: Private and government agencies must continue to support basic and applied research."
