"1","26342446","A multi-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry screening procedure for the detection in human urine of drugs non-prohibited in sport commonly used by the athletes.","This work presents an analytical method for the simultaneous analysis in human urine of 38 pharmacologically active compounds (19 benzodiazepine-like substances  7 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  4 azole antifungal drugs  5 inhibitors of the phosphodiesterases type 4 and 3 inhibitors of the phosphodiesterase type 5) by liquid-chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The above substances classes include both the most common &quot;non banned&quot; drugs used by the athletes (based on the information reported on the &quot;doping control form&quot;) and those drugs who are suspected to be performance enhancing and/or act as masking agents in particular conditions. The chromatographic separation was performed by a reverse-phase octadecyl column using as mobile phases acetonitrile and ultra-purified water  both with 0.1% formic acid. The detection was carried out using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometric analyser  positive electro-spray as ionization source and selected reaction monitoring as acquisition mode. Sample pre-treatment consisted in an enzymatic hydrolysis followed by a liquid-liquid extraction in neutral field using tert-butyl methyl-ether. The analytical procedure  once developed  was validated in terms of sensitivity (lower limits of detection in the range of 1-50 ng mL(-1))  specificity (no interferences were detected at the retention time of all the analytes under investigation)  recovery (=60% with a satisfactory repeatability  CV % lower than 10)  matrix effect (lower than 30%) and reproducibility of retention times (CV% lower than 0.1) and of relative abundances (CV% lower than 15). The performance and the applicability of the method was evaluated by analyzing real samples containing benzodiazepines (alprazolam  diazepam  zolpidem or zoplicone) or inhibitors of the phosphodiesterases type 5 (sildenafil or vardenafil) and samples obtained incubating two of the phosphodiesterases type 4 studied (cilomilast or roflumilast) with pooled human liver microsomes. All the parent compounds  together with their main phase I metabolites  were clearly detected using the analytical procedures here developed."

Drugs were selected based not only on the knowledge that the 6-hydroxylation of exogenous melatonin  its principal pathway of metabolism  is mainly mediated by hepatic CYP1A2  but also on the likelihood of the drug being concurrently administered with melatonin. Hepatic preparations were incubated with either melatonin or 6-hydroxymelatonin in the presence and absence of a range of concentrations of interacting drug  and the production of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin monitored using a radioimmunoassay procedure. Of the drugs screened  only the potent CYP1A2 inhibitor 5-methoxypsoralen impaired the 6-melatonin hydroxylation at pharmacologically relevant concentrations  and is likely to lead to clinical interactions; diazepam  tamoxifen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) did not impair the metabolic conversion of melatonin to 6-sulphatoxymelatonin at concentrations attained following therapeutic administration. 17-Ethinhyloestradiol appeared not to suppress the 6-hydroxylation of melatonin but inhibited the sulphation of 6-hydroxymelatonin  but this is unlikely to result in an interaction following therapeutic intake of the steroid. Species differences in the inhibition of melatonin metabolism in human and rat hepatic post-mitochondrial preparations were evident implying that the rat may not be an appropriate surrogate of human in such studies."

Three-step liquid/liquid extraction with online derivatization (silylation) ahead of analysis by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated on rabbit specimens in order to quantify citalopram and 4 benzodiazepines (diazepam  nordazepam  oxazepam and temazepam) in 11 biological matrices (blood  urine  bile  vitreous humor  liver  kidney  skeletal muscle  brain  adipose tissue  bone marrow (BM) and lung). Since the 11 biological matrices came from the same animal species  full validation was performed on 1 matrix  bone marrow (considered the most complex)  while the other 10 underwent partial validation. Due to non-negligible matrix effects  calibration curves were performed on each matrix. Within-day and between-day precision (less than 12.0% and 12.6%  respectively) and accuracy (from 88.9% to 106.4%) were acceptable on BM at both low and high concentrations. Assessment on the other matrices confirmed accuracy and within-day precision (less than 12%  and generally between 85.1% and 114.5%  respectively). The lower limit of quantification of the method was 1ng/g for nordazepam  5ng/g for citalopram and 10ng/g for oxazepam  diazepam and temazepam. The combination of 3-step extraction and MS/MS detection provided good selectivity in all matrices  including the most lipid-rich. Application to real-case samples showed that the method was sensitive enough to describe distribution patterns in an animal experiment  and specific enough to detect molecules in highly putrefied samples from human postmortem cases."

There are few reports regarding the in vitro metabolism of zolmitriptan. Previous studies indicated zolmitriptan was metabolized via CYP1A2 in human hepatic microsomes. In order to study the enzyme kinetics and drug interaction  the metabolism of zolmitriptan and possible drug-drug interactions were investigated in rat hepatic microsomes induced with different inducers. An active metabolite  N-demethylzolmitriptan  was detected and another minor  inactive metabolite that was reported in human hepatic microsomes was not detected in this study. The enzyme kinetics for the formation of N-demethylzolmitriptan from zolmitriptan in rat liver microsomes pretreated with BNF were 96+/-22 microM (K(m))  11+/-3 pmol min(-1)mg protein(-1) (V(max))  and 0.12+/-0.02 microl min(-1)mg protein(-1) (CL(int)). Fluvoxamine and diphenytriazol inhibited zolmitriptan N-demethylase activity catalyzed by CYP1A2 (K(i)=3.8+/-0.3 and 3.2+/-0.1 microM  respectively). Diazepam and propranolol elicited a slight inhibitory effect on the metabolism of zolmitriptan (K(i)=70+/-11 and 90+/-18 microM  respectively). Cimetidine and moclobemide produced no significant effect on the metabolism of zolmitriptan. Fluvoxamine yielded a k(inactivation) value of 0.16 min(-1)  and K(i) of 57 microM. The results suggest that rat hepatic microsomes are a reasonable model to study the metabolism of zolmitriptan  although there is a difference in the amount of minor  inactive metabolites between human hepatic microsomes and rat liver microsomes. The results of the inhibition experiments provided information for the interactions between zolmitriptan and drugs co-administrated in clinic  and it is helpful to explain the drug-drug interactions of clinical relevance on enzyme level. This study aso demonstrated that fluvoxamine may be a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP1A2."
