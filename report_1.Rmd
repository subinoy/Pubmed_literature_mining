## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(RISmed)
library(rmarkdown)
search_topic <- 'selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and autism'
search_query <- EUtilsSummary(search_topic, retmax=10000)
```

# see the ids of our returned query
```{r}
summary(search_query)
QueryId(search_query)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tally <- array()
x <- 1
for (i in 2000:2017){
    Sys.sleep(1)
    r <- EUtilsSummary('selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and autism', type='esearch',
                       db='pubmed', mindate=i, maxdate=i)
    tally[x] <- QueryCount(r)
    x <- x + 1
}

names(tally) <- 2000:2017
max(tally)
# [1] 573
```

```{r}
barplot(tally, las=2, ylim=c(0,50), 
        main="selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and autism")
```
