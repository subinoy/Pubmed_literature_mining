Seven groups of mice (12-15 g each) were administered distilled water (DW) (non-stressed and stressed controls)  sertraline (10 mg/kg)  diazepam (2 mg/kg) or one of three doses of melatonin (5  10 and 15 mg/kg). Mice were exposed to 30 min of chronic mild stress (25 min of cage shaking  cage tilting  handling and 5 min of forced swimming in tepid warm water at 25 °C  in a random order) after administration of DW or drugs  daily for 21 days. Behavioural assessments were conducted on day 1 and day 21 (after which mice were sacrificed  blood taken for estimation of corticosterone levels and brain homogenates used for estimation of antioxidant activities). Administration of melatonin resulted in an increase in horizontal locomotion and self-grooming  while rearing showed a time-dependent increase  compared to non-stress and stress controls. Working memory improved with increasing doses of melatonin (compared to controls and diazepam); in comparison to setraline however  working memory decreased. A dose-related anxiolytic effect is seen when melatonin is compared to non-stressed and stressed controls. Melatonin administration reduced the systemic/oxidant response to repeated stress. Administration of melatonin in repeatedly stressed adolescent mice was associated with improved central excitation  enhancement of working memory  anxiolysis and reduced systemic response to stress."

Additionally  the effects of factors including age on QTc intervals were estimated.METHODS: Using an open-access QT database (ECG-ViEW)  QTc-lengthening effects of 14 selected atypical antipsychotics and SSRIs were compared to those of a positive control drug  cilostazol  and a negative control drug  diazepam. We also evaluated effects of age  sexgender  and select electrolyte levels on observed QTc intervals.RESULTS: The frequency of QTc prolongation with the pooled data of the 14 study drugs was lower than that with cilostazol (age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.43  95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.27-0.69)  but no significant difference was found relative to when compared with that with diazepam (age-adjusted OR = 0.89  95% CI = 0.55-1.47). Furthermore  administration of the 14 study drugs significantly increased the QTc interval by 2.89 ms after each 10-year age increment (p-value &lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that atypical antipsychotic drugs and SSRIs are less likely to be associated with QTc prolongation in clinical settings. In addition  age showed a significant association with the QTc interval. Further studies with well-characterized cohorts are warranted."

The above substances classes include both the most common &quot;non banned&quot; drugs used by the athletes (based on the information reported on the &quot;doping control form&quot;) and those drugs who are suspected to be performance enhancing and/or act as masking agents in particular conditions. The chromatographic separation was performed by a reverse-phase octadecyl column using as mobile phases acetonitrile and ultra-purified water  both with 0.1% formic acid. The detection was carried out using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometric analyser  positive electro-spray as ionization source and selected reaction monitoring as acquisition mode. Sample pre-treatment consisted in an enzymatic hydrolysis followed by a liquid-liquid extraction in neutral field using tert-butyl methyl-ether. The analytical procedure  once developed  was validated in terms of sensitivity (lower limits of detection in the range of 1-50 ng mL(-1))  specificity (no interferences were detected at the retention time of all the analytes under investigation)  recovery (=60% with a satisfactory repeatability  CV % lower than 10)  matrix effect (lower than 30%) and reproducibility of retention times (CV% lower than 0.1) and of relative abundances (CV% lower than 15). The performance and the applicability of the method was evaluated by analyzing real samples containing benzodiazepines (alprazolam  diazepam  zolpidem or zoplicone) or inhibitors of the phosphodiesterases type 5 (sildenafil or vardenafil) and samples obtained incubating two of the phosphodiesterases type 4 studied (cilomilast or roflumilast) with pooled human liver microsomes. All the parent compounds  together with their main phase I metabolites  were clearly detected using the analytical procedures here developed."

The underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully defined. Because of its effects on the cytochrome P450 system (CYP450)  we hypothesized that neuroprotection by fluoxetine is related to altered metabolism of retinoic acid (RA)  whose CYP450-mediated degradation in brain tissue constitutes an important step in the regulation of its site-specific auto- and paracrine actions. Using traditional pharmacological in vitro assays  the effects of fluoxetine on RA degradation were probed in crude synaptosomes from rat brain and human-derived SH-SY5Y cells  and in cultures of neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore  retinoid-dependent effects of fluoxetine on neuronal survival following glutamate exposure were investigated in rat primary neurons cells using specific retinoid receptor antagonists. Experiments revealed dose-dependent inhibition of synaptosomal RA degradation by fluoxetine along with dose-dependent increases in RA levels in cell cultures. Furthermore  fluoxetine's neuroprotective effects against glutamate excitotoxicity in rat primary neurons were demonstrated to partially depend on RA signaling. Taken together  these findings demonstrate for the first time that the potent  pleiotropic antidepressant fluoxetine directly interacts with RA homeostasis in brain tissue  thereby exerting its neuroprotective effects."

Unfortunately  neurobiological underpinnings for sex differences in motivational disruptions and their responses to dietary fat are poorly understood. To help bridge these fundamental knowledge gaps  we assessed behavioral and neurobiological responses to dietary fat in a hamster model of female-biased motivational lability. Relative to social housing  social separation reduced hedonic drive in a new behavioral assay  the reward investigational preference (RIP) test. Fluoxetine or desipramine treatment for 21  but not 7  days improved RIP test performance. Pharmacologic specificity in this test was shown by non-responsiveness to diazepam  tracazolate  propranolol  or naltrexone. In the anxiety-related feeding/exploration conflict (AFEC) test  social separation worsened latency to eat highly palatable food under anxiogenic conditions  but not in home cages. Social separation also reduced weight gain  food intake  and adiposity while elevating energy expenditure  assessed by caloric efficiency and indirect calorimetry. Furthermore  chronic high-fat feeding improved anhedonic and anxious responses to separation  particularly in females. In the motivation-influencing nucleus accumbens  females  but not males  exhibited a separation-induced anxiety-related decrease in Creb1 mRNA levels and an anhedonia-related decrease in <U+0394>Fosb mRNA levels. Consistent with its antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects on behavior  high-fat feeding elevated accumbal Creb1 and <U+0394>Fosb mRNA levels in females only. Another accumbal reward marker  Tlr4 mRNA  was elevated in females by high-fat feeding. These results show that social separation of hamsters provides a novel model of sex-dependent comorbid anhedonia  anxiety  and anorexia  and implicate accumbal CREB  <U+0394>FosB  and TLR4. Moreover  the results validate a new assay for chronic antidepressant efficacy."
"6","25840741","BDNF-TRKB signaling system of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter is implicated in the panicolytic-like effect of antidepressant drugs.","A wealth of evidence implicates the BDNF-TRKB system in the therapeutic effects of antidepressant drugs (ADs) on mood disorders. However  little is known about the involvement of this system in the panicolytic property also exerted by these compounds. In the present study we evaluated the participation of the BDNF-TRKB system of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG)  a core structure involved in the pathophysiology of panic disorder  in AD-induced panicolytic-like effects in rats. The results showed that short- (3 days) or long-term (21 days) systemic treatment with the tricyclic ADs imipramine  clomipramine or desipramine increased BDNF levels in the DPAG. Only longterm treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine was able to increase BDNF levels in this structure. After 21-day treatment  fluoxetine and the three tricyclic ADs used also increased BDNF concentration in the hippocampus  a key area implicated in their mood-related actions. Neither in the DPAG nor hippocampus did long-term treatment with the standard anxiolytics diazepam  clonazepam or buspirone affect BDNF levels. Imipramine  both after short and long-term administration  and fluoxetine under the latter regimen  raised the levels of phosphorylated TRKB in the DPAG. Short-term treatment with imipramine or BDNF microinjection inhibited escape expression in rats exposed to the elevated T maze  considered as a panicolytic-like effect. This anti-escape effect was attenuated by the intra-DPAG administration of the TRK receptor antagonist k252a. Altogether  our data suggests that facilitation of the BDNF-TRKB system in the DPAG is implicated in the panicolytic effect of ADs."
"7","25704026","The effects of AP521, a novel anxiolytic drug, in three anxiety models and on serotonergic neural transmission in rats.","We investigated the anxiolytic effects and mechanism of action of a new anxiolytic drug  (R)-piperonyl-1 2 3 4-tetrahydro[1]benzothieno[2 3-c]pyridine-3- carboxamide hydrochloride (AP521). AP521 showed equal or more potent anxiolytic-like effects compared with diazepam  a benzodiazepine receptor agonist  or tandospirone  a partial 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptor agonist  in three rat anxiety models; the Vogel-type conflict test  elevated plus maze test  and conditioned fear stress test. Although AP521 did not bind to the benzodiazepine receptor  it did bind to 5-HT1A  5-HT1B  5-HT1D  5-HT5A and 5-HT7 receptors  and showed agonist activity for the human 5-HT1A receptor expressed in HEK293 cells. Tandospirone  which can stimulate the presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the raphe  tended to decrease extracellular 5-HT concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in rats. In contrast  AP521 increased extracellular 5-HT concentration. In addition  AP521 enhanced the anti-freezing effect of citalopram  a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  in the fear conditioning model in rats and enhanced the citalopram-caused increase of the extracellular 5-HT concentration in the mPFC. These results suggest that AP521 exhibits potent anxiolytic effects by acting as a postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor agonist and by enhancing serotonergic neural transmission in the mPFC by a novel mechanism of action."
"8","25694077","Benzo- and thienobenzo- diazepines: multi-target drugs for CNS disorders.","Benzodiazepines (BZ or BZD) are a class of gabaminergic psychoactive chemicals used in hypnotics  sedation  in the treatment of anxiety  and in other CNS disorders. These drugs include alprazolam (Xanax)  diazepam (Valium)  clonazepam (Klonopin)  and others. There are two distinct types of pharmacological binding sites for benzodiazepines in the brain (BZ1 and BZ2)  these sites are on GABA-A receptors  and are classified as short  intermediate  or long-acting. From the thienobenzodiazepine class (TBZ)  Olanzapine (2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-l-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno[2 3-b][1 5]benzodiazepine) (Zyprexa) was used as an example to demonstrate the antagonism of this class of compounds for multiples receptors including: dopamine D1-D5  a-adrenoreceptor  histamine H1  muscarinic M1-M5 and 5-HT2A  5-HT2B  5-HT2C  5-HT3 and 5-HT6 receptors. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent  structurally related to clozapine  and extensively used for the treatment of schizophrenia  bipolar disorder-associated mania  and the behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. The functional blockade of these multiple receptors contributes to the wide range of its pharmacologic and therapeutic activities  having relatively few side effects when compared to other antipsychotics agents. Thienobenzodiazepines (such as Olanzapine) are characterized as multi- receptor- targeted- acting- agents. This mini-review discusses these 2 drug classes that act on the central nervous system  the main active compounds used  and the various receptors with which they interact. In addition  we propose 12 olanzapine analogues  and generated Random Forest models  from a data set obtained from the ChEMBL database  to classify the structures as active or inactive against 5 dopamine receptors (D1  D2  D3  D4  D5 and D6)  and dopamine transporter."
"9","25590967","Fluvoxamine alleviates seizure activity and downregulates hippocampal GAP-43 expression in pentylenetetrazole-kindled mice: role of 5-HT3 receptors.","Epilepsy has been documented to lead to many changes in the nervous system including cell loss and mossy fiber sprouting. Neuronal loss and aberrant neuroplastic changes in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus have been identified in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling model. Antiseizure activity of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has been reported in several studies. In the current study  the protective effect of fluvoxamine against PTZ-kindling was investigated in terms of seizure scores  neuronal loss  and regulation of hippocampal neuroplasticity. Further  the role of 5-HT3 receptors was determined. Kindling was induced by repeated injections of PTZ (35<U+2009>mg/kg) thrice weekly  for a total of 13 injections. One hundred male albino mice were allocated into 10 groups: (1) saline  (2) PTZ  (3) diazepam (1<U+2009>mg/kg)+PTZ  (4-6) fluvoxamine (5  10 or 20<U+2009>mg/kg)+PTZ  (7) ondansetron+fluvoxamine (20<U+2009>mg/kg)+PTZ  (8) ondansetron+PTZ group  (9) ondansetron (2<U+2009>mg/kg  i.p.)+saline  and (10) fluvoxamine (20<U+2009>mg/kg)+saline. PTZ-kindled mice showed high seizure activity  hippocampal neuronal loss  and expression of growth-associated phosphoprotein (GAP-43) compared with saline-treated mice. Repeated administration of fluvoxamine (20<U+2009>mg/kg) in PTZ-kindled mice suppressed seizure scores  protected against hippocampal neuronal loss  and downregulated GAP-43 expression  without producing any signs of the 5-HT syndrome in healthy rats. Importantly  pretreatment with a selective 5-HT3 receptor blocker (ondansetron) attenuated the aforementioned effects of fluvoxamine. In conclusion  the ameliorating effect of fluvoxamine on hippocampal neurons and neuroplasticity in PTZ-kindled mice was  at least in part  dependent on enhancement of hippocampal serotoninergic transmission at 5-HT3 receptors."
"10","25589252","An UPLC-MS/MS method for the analysis of glimepiride and fluoxetine in human plasma.","A sensitive and rapid ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed to determine glimepiride (GPD) and fluoxetine (FLU) in human plasma using diazepam as the internal standard (IS) simultaneously. The presented method used an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column for chromatographic separation with tandem mass spectrometric detection on a QTrap5500 mass spectrometer operated in positive ESI mode. The mobile phase is a mixture of acetonitrile and 1% formic acid in water with gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.40mL/min. The GPD  FLU and IS were eluted at 1.46  1.27 and 1.39min  respectively. The MRM transitions of m/z 491.3<U+2192>126.3 and m/z 310.5<U+2192>148.1 were used to quantify for GPD and FLU  respectively. The linearity of this method was found to be within the concentration range of 2.5-300ng/mL and 0.1-20ng/mL for GPD and FLU in human plasma  respectively. The intra- and inter-day precision (RSD%) were less than 10.3% and accuracy (RE%) was within ±7.3%. The matrix effect were 95.3-100.7% for GPD and FLU. GPD and FLU were sufficiently stable under all relevant analytical conditions. The method was also successfully applied to the clinical samples after a single oral dose of 2mg GLP and 40mg FLU in patients."
"11","25435080","Involvement of the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor in the anxiolytic effects of GlyT1 inhibitors on maternal separation-induced ultrasonic vocalization in rat pups.","Several studies have shown that glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitors have anxiolytic actions. There are two types of glycine receptor: the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor (GlyA) and the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor (GlyB); however  which receptor is the main contributor to the anxiolytic actions of GlyT1 inhibitors is yet to be determined. Here  we clarified which glycine receptor is the main contributor to the anxiolytic effects of GlyT1 inhibitors by using maternal separation-induced ultrasonic vocalization (USV) by rat pups as an index of anxiety. We confirmed that administration of the benzodiazepine diazepam or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitaloplam  which are both clinically proven anxiolytics  or the GlyT1 inhibitor SSR504734 (2-chloro-N-[(S)-phenyl[(2S)-piperidin-2-yl] methyl]-3-trifluoromethyl benzamide)  decreases USV in rat pups. In addition  we showed that another GlyT1 inhibitor  ALX5407 ((R)-N-[3-(4'-fluorophenyl)-3(4'-phenylphenoxy)propyl]sarcosine) also decreases USV in rat pups. SSR504734- or ALX5407-induced decreases in USV were dose-dependently reversed by administration of the GlyA antagonist strychnine  whereas the diazepam- or escitalopram-induced decreases in USV were not. Furthermore  GlyT1-induced decreases in USV were not reversed by administration of the GlyB antagonist L-687 414. Together  these results suggest that GlyA activation is the main contributor to the anxiolytic actions of GlyT1 inhibitors and that the anxiolytic actions of diazepam and escitalopram cannot be attributed to GlyA activation. Our findings provide new insights into the importance of the activation of GlyA in the anxiolytic effects of GlyT1 inhibitors."

An intercalation of a drug in the outer half of the membrane lipid bilayer leads to echinocytosis  an intercalation in the inner half to stomatocytosis. We have used the shape transforming capacity of RBCs as a model to analyse the membrane interaction potential of various neurotropic drugs. Chlorpromazine  clomipramine  citalopram  clonazepam  and diazepam induced a reversible stomatocytosis  phenytoin induced echinocytosis  while the anticonvulsants levetiracetam  valproic acid and phenobarbital had no effect. This diversity of RBC shape transformations suggests that the pharmacological action is not linked to the membrane interaction. We conclude that this simple RBC shape transformation assay could be a useful tool to screen for potential drug interactions with cell membranes."

In this study  the effects of Haloperidol  Fluoxetine hydrochloride  Diazepam and Acepromazine drugs used for the therapy of antidepressant and antipsychotic diseases  on paraoxonase enzyme activity was studied in in vitro inhibition studies on purified human serum PON1. PON1 enzyme was purified from human blood using two-step procedures  namely  ammonium sulfate precipitation and sepharose-4B-l-tyrosine-1-napthylamine hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The overall purification of human serum PON1 was obtained in a activity of 109.29 U/mL and this enzyme was purified 125-fold. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme indicates a single band with an apparent MW of 43<U+2009>kDa. Inhibition studies indicated that haloperidol and fluoxetine hydrocloride were effective inhibitors on purified human serum PON1 activity with IC50 of 0.187 and 3.08<U+2009>mM values  respectively. The kinetics of interaction of haloperidol and fluoxetine hydrocloride with the purified human serum PON1 indicated uncompetitive inhibiton pattern with Ki of 4.15 and 0.007<U+2009>mM  respectively."

Animal models such as barbiturate sleep-induction  light-dark box  elevated plus maze  forced swimming test  tail suspension test and open field test were conducted. Male Albino Swiss mice were treated orally with vehicle 10 mL/kg  fluoxetine 20 mg/kg  imipramine 15 mg/kg  diazepam 1 mg/kg or oleanolic acid 5-40 mg/kg. Pretreatment (intraperitoneal) of animals with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) 20 mg/kg  1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4- (2-phthalimido) butyl]piperazine hydrobromide (NAN-190) 0.5 mg/kg  p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA) 100 mg/kg or a-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) 100 mg/kg  WAY100635 (WAY) 0.3 mg/kg  prazosin (PRAZ) 1 mg/kg  yohimbine 2 mg/kg as well as monoamine oxidase assay and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) quantification were carried out. Oleanolic acid potentiated the hypnotic effect of barbiturate and demonstrated an anxiolytic effect in both the light-dark box and elevated plus maze. This effect was not reversed by PTZ. Acute and/or chronic oral treatment of mice with oleanolic acid (5-20 mg/kg) elicited an antidepressant effect in the forced swimming test and the tail suspension test without interfering with the locomotor activity. The antidepressant effect of oleanolic acid was attenuated by NAN-190  AMPT  PCPA  WAY and PRAZ. Although monoamine oxidase activity remained unaltered by oleanolic acid  chronic administration of oleanolic acid augmented hippocampal BDNF level. These findings demonstrate multiple mechanisms of the anxiolytic and antidepressant effect of oleanolic acid."
"15","24732412","Potential drug interactions with melatonin.","Possible interactions of melatonin with concurrently administered drugs were investigated in in vitro studies utilising human hepatic post-mitochondrial preparations; similar studies were conducted with rat preparations to ascertain whether rat is a suitable surrogate for human. Drugs were selected based not only on the knowledge that the 6-hydroxylation of exogenous melatonin  its principal pathway of metabolism  is mainly mediated by hepatic CYP1A2  but also on the likelihood of the drug being concurrently administered with melatonin. Hepatic preparations were incubated with either melatonin or 6-hydroxymelatonin in the presence and absence of a range of concentrations of interacting drug  and the production of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin monitored using a radioimmunoassay procedure. Of the drugs screened  only the potent CYP1A2 inhibitor 5-methoxypsoralen impaired the 6-melatonin hydroxylation at pharmacologically relevant concentrations  and is likely to lead to clinical interactions; diazepam  tamoxifen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) did not impair the metabolic conversion of melatonin to 6-sulphatoxymelatonin at concentrations attained following therapeutic administration. 17-Ethinhyloestradiol appeared not to suppress the 6-hydroxylation of melatonin but inhibited the sulphation of 6-hydroxymelatonin  but this is unlikely to result in an interaction following therapeutic intake of the steroid. Species differences in the inhibition of melatonin metabolism in human and rat hepatic post-mitochondrial preparations were evident implying that the rat may not be an appropriate surrogate of human in such studies."
"16","24500275","Urinary diazepam metabolite distribution in a chronic pain population.","Diazepam is often used as an adjuvant to pain therapy. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 2C19 metabolize diazepam into the active metabolites: nordiazepam  temazepam and oxazepam. Owing to diazepam's side-effect profile  mortality risk and potential for drug-drug interactions with CYP 3A4 and/or CYP 2C19 inhibitors  urine drug testing (UDT) could be a helpful monitoring tool. This was a retrospective data analysis that evaluated urine specimens from pain management practices for the distribution of diazepam metabolites with and without CYP 3A4 and 2C19 inhibitors. Intersubject nordiazepam  temazepam and oxazepam geometric mean fractions were 0.16  0.34 and 0.47  respectively. Intrasubject geometric mean fractions were 0.157  0.311 and 0.494  respectively. Sex  but not age or urinary pH  had an effect on metabolite fractions. Methadone significantly increased temazepam and oxazepam urinary fractions via CYP3A4 inhibition  whereas fluoxetine and esomeprazole increased nordiazepam fractions via CYP2C19 inhibition. Although more studies are needed  these results suggest the viability of UDT for increased monitoring for therapy and possible drug-drug interactions."
"17","24291732","Chronic mild stress-induced changes of risk assessment behaviors in mice are prevented by chronic treatment with fluoxetine but not diazepam.","As an important part of risk-related defensive behavior and central element of anxiety  risk assessment in rodents is particularly sensitive to psychosocial stress and may consequently influence the following decision-making and behavioral output. In this study  using a mouse-test battery  we evaluated the possible impacts of chronic mild stress (CMS) on risk assessment behaviors and action selections. For non-stressed control animals  a close relationship between risk assessment and choice behavior was observed in EPM and LDT. For stressed animals  however  5 weeks of CMS exposure not only increased risk assessment behaviors  but also abolished the correlations between risk assessment and action selection. Pharmacological intervention with GABA-A receptor modulator diazepam (0.25-4 mg/kg) blocked the alterations of conventional spatiotemporal behaviors in response to CMS  but had no effect on the CMS-induced risk assessment behavioral changes. In contrast  4-weeks of chronic treatment with fluoxetine (4-20mg/kg)  a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  not only ameliorated the CMS-affected risk-assessment behaviors  but also restored the CMS-impaired correlations between risk assessment and decision making-related action selection. The present findings may shed new light on the better understanding of emotional reactivity and decision making under stressful situations. These results also indicate a differential pharmacological sensitivity in CMS-affected emotional response and risk-assessment behaviors."

Of particular interest is OCT3 expression and function in the brain  where it plays a role in serotonin clearance and influences mood and behavior. Protein kinase signaling mediates rapid modulation of cerebral processes  but little is known about acute regulation of OCT3 by protein kinases. Therefore  we cloned mouse OCT3 (mOCT3) and generated a human embryonic kidney cell line stably expressing the transporter to study transport characteristics  acute regulation by protein kinases  and interaction with psychotropic drugs. Uptake measurement was performed using the fluorescent cation 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (ASP(+)  1 µM) as a substrate. The translational value of these findings was determined by comparing results obtained with cloned mouse and human OCT3. mOCT3-mediated transport is membrane potential dependent and pH independent. ASP(+) uptake by mOCT3 and human OCT3 (hOCT3) was efficiently inhibited by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium  tetrapentylammonium (TPA(+))  corticosterone  serotonin  and histamine and by the drugs ketamine  fluoxetine  and diazepam. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations of mOCT3 and hOCT3 for TPA(+)  serotonin  diazepam  and ketamine are significantly different. Diazepam is a non-transported inhibitor. Furthermore  the activities of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are acutely regulated by the p56 (lck) tyrosine kinase by decreasing their V max. Studies with freshly isolated renal proximal tubules from mOCT1/2(-/-) mice  in which mOCT3 is the only OCT present  confirmed this regulation pathway. Only the activity of hOCT3 is regulated by calmodulin. These findings suggest that even though many transport properties of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are similar  there are also species-specific aspects of OCT3 function."

The presence of numerous pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in treated wastewater and their potential transfer into food produce such as vegetables poses an unknown human health risk. The goal of this study was to identify PPCPs that have a comparatively high potential for plant uptake and translocation. A total of 20 frequently-occurring PPCPs were compared for their accumulation into four staple vegetables (lettuce  spinach  cucumber  and pepper) grown in nutrient solutions containing PPCPs at 0.5 or 5µgL(-1). Triclocarban  fluoxetine  triclosan  and diazepam were found at high levels in roots  while meprobamate  primidone  carbamazepine  dilantin  and diuron exhibited more active translocation from roots to leaves. Root uptake of neutral PPCPs was positively correlated with the pH adjusted log Kow(i.e.  log Dow)  and was likely driven by chemical adsorption onto the root surfaces. In contrast  translocation from roots to leaves was negatively related to log Dow  suggesting hydrophilicity-regulated transport via xylems. Compounds preferentially sorbed to roots should be further evaluated for their uptake in tuber vegetables (e.g.  carrot  radish) under field conditions  while those easily translocated into leaves (e.g.  carbamazepine  dilantin) merit focused consideration for leafy and other vegetables (e.g.  lettuce  cucumber). However  estimation of dietary intake by humans suggested the implied risks from exposure to PPCPs via wastewater irrigation to be negligible."

Clinically  benzodiazepines are frequently used in combination with standard antidepressants both for initial treatment and maintenance therapy  especially when comorbid anxiety is present. However  very little is known regarding the consequence of combined treatment of benzodiazepines and antidepressant on the development of clinical effect. The current study therefore examined the effect of co-administration of fluoxetine and the benzodiazepine  diazepam  on hippocampal neurogenesis in the social isolation rodent model of chronic stress. We demonstrate that 9 weeks of social isolation induces a deficit in motivational behaviour with increased anxiety as well as impairment in hippocampal neurogenesis. This was parallelled by reduced BDNF levels in the hippocampus. While treatment with fluoxetine alone for 3 weeks restored anxiety behaviour as well as progenitor cell proliferation and the generation of new hippocampal neurons  this effect was prevented by co-administration with diazepam. This suggests that co-administering benzodiazepines with antidepressants could significantly delay or prevent the cellular and behavioural improvement needed by patients. These findings indicate the need for future clinical studies designed to investigate the combined effects of benzodiazepines and antidepressants in patients."

However  no studies have yet assessed the defensive behaviour repertoire of animals in this modified test. In Experiment 1  factor analysis was employed to characterise the behavioural profile of mice exposed to the oEPM. Experiments 2 and 3 assessed the effects of acute alprazolam (0.5-1.5mg/kg; diazepam 0.5-1.5mg/kg)  pentylenetetrazole (10.0-30.0mg/kg)  yohimbine (2.0-6.0mg/kg)  mCPP (0.3-3.0mg/kg)  and acute and chronic fluoxetine (10.0-30.0mg/kg) and imipramine (1.0-15.0mg/kg) on behaviours identified in Experiment 1. The factor analyses revealed that behaviour in the oEPM can largely (77% total variance) be accounted for in terms of 3 factors: factor 1 ('depth exploration'; e.g. head-dipping on the arms)  factor 2 ('cautious exploration of arms'; e.g. flatback approach)  and factor 3 ('risk assessment'; stretched attend postures - SAP). Experiments 2 and 3 showed that  over the dose range used  alprazolam selectively attenuated all measures of defensiveness. Similar  though more modest  effects were seen with diazepam. Confirming the intensity of the emotional response to the oEPM (nociceptive  endocrine and behavioural)  relatively few significant behavioural changes were seen in response to the anxiogenic compounds tested. Although acute fluoxetine or imipramine treatment failed to modify behaviour in the oEPM  chronic fluoxetine (but not chronic imipramine) attenuated total flat back approach and increased head dipping outside the central square. Together  the results indicate that the oEPM induces behavioural defensive responses that are sensitive to alprazolam and chronic fluoxetine."

However  serotonin syndrome  seizures  electrocardiographic abnormalities as well as respiratory failure and death have been described in patients with citalopram overdose. The mechanisms of severe toxicity remain unclear. Our objective was to study the mechanisms of death following high-dose citalopram administration in Sprague Dawley rats. The median lethal dose (MLD) of intraperitoneal (i.p.) citalopram was measured using Dixon &amp; Bruce's up-and-down method at 102 mg/kg. Dose-effect relationships of citalopram-induced clinical features  alterations in arterial blood gas and plethysmography  and disturbances in blood lactate  plasma and platelet serotonin concentrations were studied. Seizures were significantly increased in rats receiving 80% and 120% of citalopram MLD versus controls (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01  respectively). A significant decrease in body temperature was observed after 90 min in rats treated with doses &gt;60% MLD in comparison to controls (p&lt;0.05). The occurrence of serotonin behavioural syndrome was comparable in all groups. Citalopram administration did not result in significant hypoxemia  hypercapnia and lactate elevation. However  a significant moderate increase in the inspiratory time (p&lt;0.05) accompanied with an expiratory braking was observed. A significant dose-related linear decrease in platelet serotonin and increase in plasma serotonin concentrations were measured (p&lt;0.05). Pre-treatments of rats receiving 120% of citalopram MLD with diazepam (1.77 mg/kg) and cyproheptadine (17.1mg/kg) prevented seizures and death  but propranolol pre-treatment was ineffective. Neuroprotection with diazepam and cyproheptadine was not associated with decreased serotonin plasma concentrations. In conclusion  citalopram-induced deaths resulted from seizures in relation to serotonin release  whilst respiratory and metabolic toxicity was mild. Our observations support the role of serotonin-induced neurotoxicity in citalopram overdose and suggest that cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines  but not beta-blockers  may have a role in the management of citalopram toxicity."

It is therefore important that their efficiency in removing hazardous trace organic contaminants be assessed. Accordingly  this study investigated the removal of trace organic chemical contaminants through a full-scale  package MBR in New South Wales  Australia. This study was unique in the context of MBR research because it characterised the removal of 48 trace organic chemical contaminants  which included steroidal hormones  xenoestrogens  pesticides  caffeine  pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Results showed that the removal of most trace organic chemical contaminants through the MBR was high (above 90%). However  amitriptyline  carbamazepine  diazepam  diclofenac  fluoxetine  gemfibrozil  omeprazole  sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim were only partially removed through the MBR with the removal efficiencies of 24-68%. These are potential indicators for assessing MBR performance as these chemicals are usually sensitive to changes in the treatment systems. The trace organic chemical contaminants detected in the MBR permeate were 1 to 6 orders of magnitude lower than guideline values reported in the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling. The outcomes of this study enhanced our understanding of the levels and removal of trace organic contaminants by MBRs."

Since long-term exposure to glucocorticoids  major stress hormones from adrenal gland  is known to downregulate the mRNA expression of intestinal calcium transporter TRPV6  the present study aimed to demonstrate whether decreases in mRNA expressions of duodenal calcium transporter genes were observed in male rats subjected to restraint stress for 4 weeks. The results from quantitative real-time PCR showed that restraint stress significantly downregulated the mRNA expressions of apical calcium channels (TRPV6 and Ca(v)1.3)  cytoplasmic calcium-binding protein (calbindin-D(9k))  and basolateral calcium pump (PMCA(1b))  but not the expression of TRPV5 or NCX1. The mRNA expressions of paracellular genes  ZO-1  occludin  and claudin-3  were not altered by restraint stress. Since several antidepressant or anxiolytic drugs effectively alleviate stress-induced depressive and anxiety symptoms  we further hypothesized that these drugs may also enhance calcium transporter gene expression in stressed rats. As expected  4-week daily administration of 10 mg/kg fluoxetine  10 mg/kg reboxetine  or 10 mg/kg venlafaxine differentially increased calcium transporter mRNA expression in stressed rats  whereas 2 mg/kg diazepam had no such effect. It could  therefore  be concluded that 4-week restraint stress downregulated some important calcium transporter mRNA expression in the duodenal epithelial cells of male rats  which could be prevented by oral administration of fluoxetine  reboxetine  and venlafaxine. The present findings may be applied to help alleviate the stress-induced bone loss and osteoporosis by restoring intestinal calcium absorption to provide calcium for bone formation."
"25","22641177","An affective disorder in zebrafish with mutation of the glucocorticoid receptor.","Upon binding of cortisol  the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates the transcription of specific target genes  including those that encode the stress hormones corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Dysregulation of the stress axis is a hallmark of major depression in human patients. However  it is still unclear how glucocorticoid signaling is linked to affective disorders. We identified an adult-viable zebrafish mutant in which the negative feedback on the stress response is disrupted  due to abolition of all transcriptional activity of GR. As a consequence  cortisol is elevated  but unable to signal through GR. When placed into an unfamiliar aquarium ('novel tank')  mutant fish become immobile ('freeze')  show reduced exploratory behavior and do not habituate to this stressor upon repeated exposure. Addition of the antidepressant fluoxetine to the holding water and social interactions restore normal behavior  followed by a delayed correction of cortisol levels. Fluoxetine does not affect the overall transcription of CRH  the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)  the serotonin transporter (Serta) or GR itself. Fluoxetine  however  suppresses the stress-induced upregulation of MR and Serta in both wild-type fish and mutants. Our studies show a conserved  protective function of glucocorticoid signaling in the regulation of emotional behavior and reveal novel molecular aspects of how chronic stress impacts vertebrate brain physiology and behavior. Importantly  the zebrafish model opens up the possibility of high-throughput drug screens in search of new classes of antidepressants."

However  little is known about how psychotropic drugs affect the mechanism of the human response to mental stress. We investigated the influence of psychotropic drugs on plasma BDNF levels under mental stress using a driving simulator (DS) task.METHODS: Fourteen healthy male volunteers received one of four drugs  diazepam (5<U+2009>mg)  tandospirone (20<U+2009>mg)  paroxetine (10<U+2009>mg)  and matched placebo  in a double-blind  crossover manner.

Plasma BDNF levels were measured before and after the DS task.RESULTS: Plasma BDNF levels under the placebo  diazepam  and tandospirone conditions significantly decreased after the DS task compared with before the task. Conversely  no significant differences in plasma BDNF levels were detected under the paroxetine condition.CONCLUSION: As these three psychotropic drugs have differential effects on plasma BDNF levels under mental stress after 4<U+2009>h post-dosing  antidepressants  unlike anxiolytics  might have a prompt positive effect on the mental stress response."

Three-step liquid/liquid extraction with online derivatization (silylation) ahead of analysis by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated on rabbit specimens in order to quantify citalopram and 4 benzodiazepines (diazepam  nordazepam  oxazepam and temazepam) in 11 biological matrices (blood  urine  bile  vitreous humor  liver  kidney  skeletal muscle  brain  adipose tissue  bone marrow (BM) and lung). Since the 11 biological matrices came from the same animal species  full validation was performed on 1 matrix  bone marrow (considered the most complex)  while the other 10 underwent partial validation. Due to non-negligible matrix effects  calibration curves were performed on each matrix. Within-day and between-day precision (less than 12.0% and 12.6%  respectively) and accuracy (from 88.9% to 106.4%) were acceptable on BM at both low and high concentrations. Assessment on the other matrices confirmed accuracy and within-day precision (less than 12%  and generally between 85.1% and 114.5%  respectively). The lower limit of quantification of the method was 1ng/g for nordazepam  5ng/g for citalopram and 10ng/g for oxazepam  diazepam and temazepam. The combination of 3-step extraction and MS/MS detection provided good selectivity in all matrices  including the most lipid-rich. Application to real-case samples showed that the method was sensitive enough to describe distribution patterns in an animal experiment  and specific enough to detect molecules in highly putrefied samples from human postmortem cases."

Since there is evidence that Mg(2+) modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis  we tested whether enhanced anxiety-like behaviour can be reliably elicited by dietary Mg(2+) deficiency and whether Mg(2+) deficiency is associated with altered HPA axis function. Compared with controls  Mg(2+) deficient mice did indeed display enhanced anxiety-related behaviour in a battery of established anxiety tests. The enhanced anxiety-related behaviour of Mg(2+) deficient mice was sensitive to chronic desipramine treatment in the hyponeophagia test and to acute diazepam treatment in the open arm exposure test. Mg(2+) deficiency caused an increase in the transcription of the corticotropin releasing hormone in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN)  and elevated ACTH plasma levels  pointing to an enhanced set-point of the HPA axis. Chronic treatment with desipramine reversed the identified abnormalities of the stress axis. Functional mapping of neuronal activity using c-Fos revealed hyper-excitability in the PVN of anxious Mg(2+) deficient mice and its normalisation through diazepam treatment. Overall  the present findings demonstrate the robustness and validity of the Mg(2+) deficiency model as a mouse model of enhanced anxiety  showing sensitivity to treatment with anxiolytics and antidepressants. It is further suggested that dysregulations in the HPA axis may contribute to the hyper-emotionality in response to dietary induced hypomagnesaemia.

"29","21820452","Susceptibility to the long-term anxiogenic effects of an acute stressor is mediated by the activation of the glucocorticoid receptors.","The specificity of the response of an organism is an important variable influencing stress-related parameters and psychopathological states. We have shown that trait anxiety in C57BL/6 mice  determined by their emergence latencies in the free choice open field test  positively correlates with the long-term behavioral and neuroendocrinological changes induced by a stressor. Here  we show that this interindividual variability is caused by a different reactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis upon exposure to a stressor. Mice with high trait anxiety (long emergence latency  LEL) display a more pronounced stress-induced activation of the HPA axis than mice with low trait anxiety (short emergence latency  SEL). Moreover  stress-induced activation of tyrosine hydroxylase and corticotropin-releasing hormone occurred in LEL but not SEL mice. In search of the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences  we found that under non-stressed conditions mRNA and protein levels of the glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus were higher in LEL mice compared to SEL mice. Also  systemic injection of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 decreased the stress-induced activation of the HPA axis and the long-term anxiogenic effects of stress observed in LEL mice. Finally  the rewarding properties of cocaine were enhanced in LEL mice compared to SEL mice  suggesting a causal link between trait anxiety  stress activity and the behavioral responses to drugs of addiction."

Treatment with anxiolytic benzodiazepines (BZs) may reduce these effects  although little is known about potential drug interactions. Our study evaluated acute anxiogenic-like effects of SSRIs  alone and combined with a BZ. Adult male BALB/c mice received fluoxetine (3.0-30.0mg/kg  i.p.) or citalopram (3.0-30.0mg/kg  i.p.) alone or in combination with diazepam (0.3-10.0mg/kg  i.p.)  after which they were evaluated with the light/dark and open-field tests for anxiogenesis/anxiolysis. In addition  release of the stress hormone corticosterone was assessed following combined SSRI/BZ administration. In the light/dark and open-field tests  acute SSRIs produced a behavioral profile consistent with anxiogenesis  while diazepam produced an anxiolytic-like profile. Pre-treatment with diazepam (0.3-10mg/kg) reversed the effects of an anxiogenic-like dose of an SSRI (18mg/kg fluoxetine  30mg/kg citalopram) in both light/dark and open-field tests. Diazepam  fluoxetine or citalopram  and their combination all significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels to the same degree. These findings suggest that a BZ-type drug can attenuate acute anxiogenic-like effects of an SSRI via a mechanism independent of corticosterone regulation."

However  because only few animal models display overt anxious-like behavior  detailed preclinical studies of the anxiolytic properties of antidepressants are still lacking. Here  we studied the neurochemical and behavioral effects of a double 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor knockout in mice (5-HT(1A/1B)-/-) as compared to their wild-type littermates (5-HT(1A/1B)+/+). It is known that single deletion of either 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(1B) receptor induces behavioral changes that are not correlated with differences in brain serotonergic tone. Deletion of both receptors resulted in (i) higher emotionality of animals  as observed in three unconditioned paradigms of anxiety (open field  elevated plus maze and novelty suppressed feeding tests); (ii) a 200% increase in the mean spontaneous firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) compared to 5-HT(1A/1B)+/+ mice; (iii) elevated basal dialysate levels of 5-HT in the DRN and frontal cortex; (iv) an exaggerated response to acute paroxetine administration in microdialysis experiments  and (v) increased basal core body temperature. These findings suggest that the deletion of both autoreceptors induces a strong anxious-like behavioral state associated with increased 5-HT neurotransmission. Interestingly  5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mice are still sensitive to the acute administration of diazepam. Moreover  while deletion of both receptors impacted on the response to acute SSRI treatment in the forced swim test  anxiolytic-like effects of a chronic SSRI treatment were still observed in 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mice. Thus  the 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mouse model could be of great interest to unveil the mechanisms of action of the anxiolytic effects of SSRIs."
"32","20678516","Pharmacological evaluation of a novel assay for detecting glycine transporter 1 inhibitors and their antipsychotic potential.","Multiple lines of evidence support the notion that hypofunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Moreover  glycine and glycine modulators have beneficial effects in patients with schizophrenia  particularly when added on to existing therapy. As glycine is an obligatory co-agonist at the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor  blockade of glycine uptake at the glycine transporter type-1 (GlyT1) can enhance low glutamatergic tone. L-687 414 is an antagonist at the glycine modulatory site of the NMDA complex and  behaviorally  increases locomotion. A series of GlyT1 inhibitors along with other psychoactive compounds were examined for their ability to enhance or inhibit the action of L-687 414. GlyT1 inhibitors and the other compounds were examined initially for effects on [(3)H]-glycine uptake in CHO cells expressing hGlyT1b cDNA and for their ability to displace the NMDA-glycine site ligand [(3)H]-L-689 560 from isolated rat forebrain membrane preparations. The in vivo activity of these compounds was determined in mice by measuring their ability to prevent L-687 414-induced hyperlocomotion. GlyT1 inhibitors blocked [(3)H]-glycine uptake in cells expressing the human transporter; other compounds had little or no activity. None of the compounds had affinity for the glycine site of the NMDA receptor complex. Hyperlocomotion induced by L-687 414 was dose-dependently reduced by GlyT1 inhibitors and antipsychotic drugs but not by morphine  fluoxetine or a moderate dose of diazepam. Therefore  this behavioral approach can reliably detect GlyT1 inhibitors which  in turn  may have some activity in common with drugs having antipsychotic effects."

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increase proliferation of neuronal progenitors in rodent hippocampus after a delay of approximately 2 weeks.METHODS: We have used this delayed increase in neurogenesis  as detected with both a rapid dot-blot method and with immunostaining  as a model of the delayed clinical antidepressant effects.RESULTS: Whereas the SSRI fluoxetine alone significantly increased both neurogenesis and survival of newborn cells when administered for 2-3 weeks  co-treatment with diazepam and fluoxetine completely blocked the increase in both neurogenesis and survival. Furthermore  neurogenesis was not increased when fluoxetine and diazepam were first co-administered for 2 weeks and then fluoxetine was given alone for 2 additional weeks. Moreover  we show that daily administration is necessary for neurogenesis  because injection of fluoxetine for up to 1 week failed to increase neurogenesis  when assayed at 14 days from the first injection.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that benzodiazepines might interfere with the clinical effects of fluoxetine or that increased neurogenesis is not a valid model for the delayed onset of the clinical antidepressant effects."

Using a blind stick method to draw large amounts of blood from the femoral vessel may increase the likelihood of contamination with blood from more central sites. It has been suggested that clamping the femoral vessel before drawing the sample may eliminate possible contribution from central sites. Eight drugs from four different drug classes were evaluated to determine the difference between drug concentrations in clamped and blind stick femoral blood. Drug concentrations of three selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  or SSRIs (sertraline  paroxetine  citalopram)  two benzodiazepines (diazepam and alprazolam)  two antihistamines (diphenhydramine and promethazine)  and one opiate (hydrocodone) were evaluated in clamped femoral blood  blind stick femoral blood  and heart blood and compared using concentration ratios and linear regression analysis. Clamped femoral blood concentrations and blind stick femoral blood concentrations were found to have good predictability across all drug classes with ratios around 1.0  indicating good correlation between blind stick femoral and clamped femoral samples.

We found that RG-15 showed a good oral bioavailability (54%) and high brain levels (approx. 900 ng/g) in rats and demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy in amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and conditioned avoidance response tests in rats  yielding ED50 (median effective dose) values of 8.6 and 12 mg/kg orally  respectively. At six- to eightfold higher doses  RG-15 blocked spontaneous motor activity  while a 30 mg/kg dose of the compound caused an increase in the home-cage motility of rats. The drug did not produce catalepsy up to 160 mg/kg oral dose; moreover  it inhibited haloperidol-induced catalepsy in the range 15-60 mg/kg. RG-15 (10 mg/kg orally) restored the impaired learning performance of scopolamine- or diazepam-treated rats in a water-labyrinth paradigm. It is assumed that the motor activating  anticataleptic and cognitive-enhancing properties of RG-15 result from its potent D3 antagonism. In this regard  RG 15 clearly differs from other antipsychotics. Olanzapine  clozapine and amisulpride all showed efficacy against amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and on conditioned avoidance  but compared to RG-15  they proved to be more cataleptogenic and depressed or did not change the home-cage activity of animals. Olanzapine was also inactive in the learning paradigm. Our results suggest that subnanomolar dopamine D3 receptor antagonism coupled to moderate D2 affinity may result in an antipsychotic profile characterised by a lack of extrapyramidal side effects and secondary negative symptoms with simultaneous efficacy on positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia."

Deaths associated with illicit fentanyl use occur in younger people (39.4 vs. 61.5 years) with higher fentanyl (17.1 ng/mL vs. 4.4 ng/mL) and lower morphine (76.9 ng/mL vs. 284.2 ng/mL) postmortem blood concentrations  and more frequent cocaine co-intoxication (65% vs. 3%)  than deaths associated with illicit fentanyl use. A wide range of postmortem blood concentrations of fentanyl was detected (trace-280 ng/mL)  with a minimum concentration of 7 ng/mL of fentanyl strongly associated with illicit use of fentanyl in poly-drug cases. The most commonly detected opiates/opioids in illicit fentanyl users were: morphine (29%)  oxycodone (14.5%)  and methadone (14.5%). Ethanol  cannabinoids  diazepam  citalopram  and diphenhydramine were each detected in greater than 10% of the licit fentanyl cases. Most fentanyl abusers died at their own home and their deaths were most often classified as accidental. Mapping of primary residences of decedents revealed conspicuous clustering of the illicit fentanyl use cases  as opposed to the random pattern in licit use cases. Fentanyl misuse is a public health problem in Massachusetts."

Clinically effective anxiolytics reliably reduce USVs  making this behavior a useful animal model of the anxiolytic potential of novel pharmacological approaches to the treatment of anxiety. Here  we assess the hypothesis that USV duration (total time spent vocalizing) is a more sensitive measure of anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacy than USV number by testing established and putative anxiolytics in this model. Negative geotaxis and righting reflex latency were measured to assess sedating properties. The benzodiazepines  CDP (1-10 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.3-3 mg/kg)  the 5HT(1A) partial agonist  buspirone (0.3-3 mg/kg)  and the mGluR5 antagonist  MTEP (1-30 mg/kg)  reduced USV duration at lower doses and to a greater magnitude than USV number. The benzodiazepines  unlike buspirone and MTEP  produced measurable sedation  but it was dissociable from reductions in USV duration. The SSRI antidepressants  fluoxetine (1-30 mg/kg) and citalopram (0.3-30 mg/kg)  reduced USV duration more than number with no measurable effect on sedation. The tricyclic antidepressants  imipramine (1-10 mg/kg) and amitriptyline (1-30 mg/kg)  had no effect dissociable from sedation. These data support USV duration as a more sensitive and useful measure than USV number in the isolated rat pup model."

Brain beta-endorphins were higher in experiment group treated with trazodone (929 pg/g +/- 44 43; X+/-SD)  and dibenzepine (906 63 pg/g +/- 74 06)  yet with lower brain content in rats treated with diazepam (841 55 pg/g +/- 68 47)  compared to brain beta-endorphins content of control group treated with saline solution (0 95% NaCl) (873 5 pg/g +/- 44 89). Significant differences were obtained comparing brain beta-endorphins of trazodone vs. diazepam treated animals  with diazepam group having lower values (p&lt;0 02). This study showed differences in changes of rat brain beta-endorphins contents when different psychoactive drugs are used. Therefore  we consider that beta-endorphins could be used for evaluation of effects of psychoactive drugs  as a useful parameter in therapy with these psycho-pharmaceuticals."

(+/-)-1-(2 5-Dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI; a 5-HT2A receptor agonist) also possessed strong anxiolytic-like effect in the same test. A 5-HT2A mechanism seems to be implicated in the mechanism of action of both antidepressants and DOI in this test. On the other hand  the alpha-adrenergic ligands have also demonstrated an activity in other models of anxiety. A previous study demonstrated that the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists abolished the anxiolytic-like effect of antidepressants.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of noradrenergic system on the regulation of 5-HT2 receptors implicated in the DOI anxiolytic-like activity in the FPT.METHODS: First  the effect of noradrenergic and serotonergic lesions on DOI anxiolytic-like activity was studied in the FPT. Second  the effect of co-administration of alpha-adrenoceptor ligands and DOI was evaluated in the same test.RESULTS: The noradrenergic and serotonergic lesions had no effect on DOI (1 mg/kg) anti-punishment activity in the FPT. Adrafinil 0.25 and 4 mg/kg (an alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist)  prazosin 0.5 and 2 mg/kg (an alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist) and idazoxan 1 and 4 mg/kg (an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist) did not modify the activity of DOI. Clonidine 0.06 mg/kg  guanabenz 0.125 and 0.5 mg/kg (two alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists) and guanfacine 0.06 and 0.125 mg/kg (a specific alpha2A-adrenoceptor agonist) completely abolished DOI-induced increase in punished passages.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the DOI seems to act on the 5-HT2 receptors post-synaptically located. The effect of DOI is regulated by the alpha2-adrenoceptors."

"48","15572281","Antidepressants attenuate both the enhanced ethanol intake and ethanol-induced anxiolytic effects in diazepam withdrawn rats.","We have recently shown that the abrupt discontinuation of chronic diazepam (DZM) administration facilitated ethanol consumption and enhanced the anxiolytic properties of ethanol. Tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine have been shown to reduce alcohol intake in rodent models of alcoholism and in alcoholics who are depressed. In the present study  we tested whether desipramine (1.25; 2.5 and 5 mg/kg  i.p.) and fluoxetine (5 mg/kg  i.p.) treatment affect both ethanol intake in a free-choice test and the anxiolytic effect induced by ethanol in DZM withdrawn rats. Adult male Wistar rats were submitted to a chronic DZM treatment (2 mg/kg per day) or vehicle (VEH) for 21 days. Twenty-four hours after the last DZM injection  rats were subjected to a free-choice paradigm between water and increasing ethanol concentrations with or without concurrent desipramine or fluoxetine administration (ethanol concentration (v/v) was increased every 4 days as follows: 2  4  6  8 and 10% for the final 8 days). Chronic treatment with desipramine (24 days  twice a day  2.5 and 5 mg/kg  i.p.) and fluoxetine (24 days  once a day; 5 mg/kg  i.p.) significantly reduced the amount of ethanol intake in DZM withdrawn rats. Furthermore  subchronic treatments with desipramine (4 days  twice a day  2.5 and 5 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (4 days  once a day  5 mg/kg  i.p.) blocked the anxiolytic-like behavior in the elevated plus maze induced by ethanol (1 g/kg; i.p.) in DZM withdrawn rats at day 5 of withdrawal. The present findings suggest that desipramine and fluoxetine could be effective pharmacological tools to prevent the subsequent development of ethanol dependence in rats previously exposed to DZM withdrawal."

This study investigated the effects of the coadministration of fluvoxamine on plasma concentrations of etizolam and evaluated the effects of various fluvoxamine doses on drug interactions with etizolam. Subjects were 18 Japanese outpatients concomitantly treated with fluvoxamine before or after monotherapy with etizolam. Plasma concentrations of etizolam were measured using a column-switching high-performance liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet detection. In 17 subjects treated concomitantly with fluvoxamine at 25 mg or 50 mg  the ranges of plasma concentrations of etizolam corrected for the dose increased from 2.0-13.3 (mean 6.3 +/- 3.6  n = 17) in monotherapy to 2.7-18.2 (mean 9.6 +/- 5.1  n = 17) ng/mL/mg in concomitant doses. Wide variations were observed in the drug interactions; however  coadministration with fluvoxamine produced significant changes in the plasma concentrations of etizolam (P &lt; 0.0001) with a median of 42.9% (range 0.0 to 235.0%). Although the sleepiness of the subjects was evaluated using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale  no changes in sleepiness were found between the etizolam-monotherapy and the fluvoxamine-concomitant states. Of the 12 subjects treated concomitantly with fluvoxamine at 25 mg  2 subjects received fluvoxamine at a dose increased up to 150 mg  and another received fluvoxamine at a dose increased up to 200 mg. They showed an increase in the plasma concentrations of etizolam in a fluvoxamine dose-dependent manner; more particularly  the increased dose of fluvoxamine (150 mg and 200 mg) resulted in about a twofold variation in plasma concentrations of etizolam."
"50","15100702","Role of neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone in antipsychotic-like action of olanzapine in rodents.","Olanzapine increases brain allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels sufficiently to modulate neuronal activity by allosterically regulating GABAA receptors. Recently  we reported the antipsychotic-like profile of ALLO in rodents. The present study examined the hypothesis that olanzapine-induced elevation of endogenous neurosteroid ALLO is vital for its neuroleptic-like action. The conditioned avoidance response (CAR) and apomorphine-induced climbing behavioral paradigms were used in rodents. Administration of ALLO (1 microg  intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)) or neurosteroidogenic agents such as the mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor receptor agonist  FGIN 1-27 (0.5 microg  i.c.v.) or the ALLO precursor  progesterone (10 mg/kg  i.p.) significantly potentiated olanzapine-induced blockade of CAR and apomorphine-induced climbing. In contrast  these agents failed to alter the antipsychotic-like effect of risperidone and haloperidol. On the other hand  inhibition of the endogenous biosynthesis of neurosteroids by the 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor  trilostane (30 mg/kg  i.p.)  the 3alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase inhibitor  indomethacin (5 mg/kg  i.p.)  or the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (1 mg/kg  i.p.) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (1 mg/kg  i.p.) blocked the effect of olanzapine  but not of risperidone and haloperidol. Socially isolated animals  known to exhibit decreased brain ALLO and GABAA receptor functions  displayed a shortening in the muscimol-induced loss of righting reflex and an increased susceptibility to apomorphine-induced climbing. Administration of olanzapine  but not of haloperidol and risperidone  normalized the duration of muscimol-elicited loss of righting reflex. Although all three antipsychotics proved capable of antagonizing the apomorphine-induced climbing  a dose almost five times higher of olanzapine was required in socially isolated animals. The data obtained suggest that enhancement of the GABAergic tone plays a key role in the antipsychotic-like effect exerted by olanzapine in rodents  likely as a consequence of augmented levels of neuroactive steroids  in particular ALLO  in the brain. The present findings provide the first specific behavioral evidence in support of the hypothesis that neuroactive steroid ALLO- mediated GABAergic modulation is essential for the antipsychotic-like action of olanzapine."
"51","14642738","In vitro metabolism of zolmitriptan in rat cytochromes induced with beta-naphthoflavone and the interaction between six drugs and zolmitriptan.","Zolmitriptan is a novel and highly selective 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist used as an acute oral treatment for migraine. There are few reports regarding the in vitro metabolism of zolmitriptan. Previous studies indicated zolmitriptan was metabolized via CYP1A2 in human hepatic microsomes. In order to study the enzyme kinetics and drug interaction  the metabolism of zolmitriptan and possible drug-drug interactions were investigated in rat hepatic microsomes induced with different inducers. An active metabolite  N-demethylzolmitriptan  was detected and another minor  inactive metabolite that was reported in human hepatic microsomes was not detected in this study. The enzyme kinetics for the formation of N-demethylzolmitriptan from zolmitriptan in rat liver microsomes pretreated with BNF were 96+/-22 microM (K(m))  11+/-3 pmol min(-1)mg protein(-1) (V(max))  and 0.12+/-0.02 microl min(-1)mg protein(-1) (CL(int)). Fluvoxamine and diphenytriazol inhibited zolmitriptan N-demethylase activity catalyzed by CYP1A2 (K(i)=3.8+/-0.3 and 3.2+/-0.1 microM  respectively). Diazepam and propranolol elicited a slight inhibitory effect on the metabolism of zolmitriptan (K(i)=70+/-11 and 90+/-18 microM  respectively). Cimetidine and moclobemide produced no significant effect on the metabolism of zolmitriptan. Fluvoxamine yielded a k(inactivation) value of 0.16 min(-1)  and K(i) of 57 microM. The results suggest that rat hepatic microsomes are a reasonable model to study the metabolism of zolmitriptan  although there is a difference in the amount of minor  inactive metabolites between human hepatic microsomes and rat liver microsomes. The results of the inhibition experiments provided information for the interactions between zolmitriptan and drugs co-administrated in clinic  and it is helpful to explain the drug-drug interactions of clinical relevance on enzyme level. This study aso demonstrated that fluvoxamine may be a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP1A2."

The intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by Fura 2-AM fluorescence labeling assay. Using RT-PCR  the mRNA level of nerve growth factor (NGF) was also detected.RESULTS: High concentration of corticosterone (0.2 mmol/L) was incubated with PC12 cells to simulate the lesion state of brain neurons in depressive illness. Three main kinds of antidepressants used in clinic [(1) tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  such as desipramine (DIM) 0.625-10 micromol/L; (2) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  such as fluoxetine (FLU) 0.625-10 micromol/L; (3) monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)  such as moclobemide (MOC) 2.5-40 micromol/L] protected cells from the lesion induced by corticosterone. While antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine or anxiolytic agent diazepam 0.4-50 micromol/L had no such effect. Moreover  DIM 1  5 micromol/L or FLU 1  5 micromol/L attenuated the [Ca2+]i overload induced by corticosterone 0.1 mmol/L for 48 h in PC12 cells. Furthermore  treatment with DIM or FLU 10 micromol/L for 48 h elevated the NGF mRNA expression in PC12 cells.CONCLUSION: Despite a remarkable structural diversity  the cytoprotective effect can be viewed as the common action pathway of the antidepressants. Moreover  attenuation of the intracellular Ca2+ overload and elevation of neurotrophic factor (such as NGF) expression is one of the mechanisms of cytoprotective effect of antidepressants."

Immobility time was significantly longer in diabetic than in nondiabetic mice. Diazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg s.c.) dose-dependently decreased immobility time in diabetic mice to the level observed in saline-treated nondiabetic mice. However  diazepam had no significant effect on immobility time in nondiabetic mice. Fluoxetine (3-56 mg/kg i.p.) and desipramine (1-30 mg/kg i.p.) produced marked  dose-dependent suppression of immobility time in both nondiabetic and diabetic mice. However  anti-immobility effects of fluoxetine and desipramine in diabetic mice were less than those in nondiabetic mice. Fluvoxamine (3-30 mg/kg i.p.) produced a dose-dependent suppression of immobility time in nondiabetic mice but not in diabetic mice. The anti-immobility effects of fluoxetine  fluvoxamine and desipramine in nondiabetic mice were antagonized by pretreatment with diazepam (0.3 mg/kg s.c.). Furthermore  fluoxetine  fluvoxamine and desipramine had no effect on the immobility time in diazepam (0.3 mg/kg s.c.)-treated diabetic mice. These results indicate that the anti-immobility effects of SSRIs and desipramine are less in diabetic mice than in nondiabetic mice in the tail suspension test. Furthermore  in diabetic mice  SSRIs and selective NA reuptake inhibitors did not affect immobility time even though the prolonged duration of immobility was suppressed by pretreatment with diazepam."

However  bioequivalence and therapeutic effectiveness are not necessarily the same.OBJECTIVE: This review summarizes available data comparing the bioequivalence and therapeutic efficacy of brand-name psychoactive drugs with those of the corresponding generic products.METHODS: Relevant information was identified through searches of MEDLINE  Current Contents/Clinical Medicine  and EMBASE for English-language articles and English abstracts of articles in other languages published between 1975 and the present. The search terms used were generic drug  branded drug  safety  toxicity  adverse events  clinical efficacy  bioequivalence  bioavailability  psychoactive drugs  and excipients.RESULTS: Few publications compared the bioequivalence and efficacy of brand-name and generic psychoactive drugs. Those that were identified revealed differences in the efficacy and tolerability of brand-name and generic psychoactive drugs that had not been noted in the original bioequivalence studies. Specifically  l study found that plasma levels of phenytoin were 31% lower after a switch from a brand-name to a generic product. Several controlled studies of carbamazepine showed a recurrence of convulsions after the shift to a generic formulation. After a sudden recurrence of seizures when generic valproic acid was substituted for the brand-name product  an investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration found a difference in bioavailability between the 2 formulations. Statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetic variables have been reported in favor of brand-name versus generic diazepam (P &lt; 0.001). Finally  a case report involving paroxetine mesylate cast doubt on the tolerability and efficacy of the generic formulation.CONCLUSION: The essential-similarity requirement should be extended to include more rigorous analyses of tolerability and efficacy in actual patients as well as in healthy subjects."

Twelve patients were treated with CMI and tandospirone (T group)  12 with CMI and diazepam (D group) and 12 with CMI alone (C group) for 6 weeks. No statistically significant differences in the percentage improvement of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17 items; HDRS-17) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (14 items; HARS-14) scores were shown among the three treatment groups. However  at 2 weeks  the percentage improvement of HDRS-17 score in the T group tended to be higher than that in the D and C groups  although there was no statistically significant difference among the three treatment groups. No change in plasma prolactin level or adverse events was induced by the addition of tandospirone. These results suggest that 6 weeks of treatment with tandospirone or diazepam was not effective for augmentation of CMI in major depressive disorder patients. However  augmentation of antidepressants by tandospirone administration for a few weeks might induce early expression of antidepressive effects."
"57","12600706","Stress-induced vocalisation in adult animals. A valid model of anxiety?","The post-stimuli anticipatory vocalisations that follow stressful and painful conditions are suggested as a quantitative measure of the emotional state of fear and anxiety in animal models. Adult rats emit characteristic 22-kHz ultrasound vocalisations consisting of 20-30 kHz calls with a mean duration of 300-600 ms as response to aversive stimuli (e.g. inescapable electric footshock  acoustic or air-puff stimuli  agonistic encounter or withdrawal from treatment with drugs of abuse). The vocalisations are accompanied by defensive submissive behaviour and signal a refractory  socially withdrawn or helpless state. Furthermore  brain structures that are involved in the mediation of anxiety-like behaviour  e.g. the dorsal periaqueductal grey and cortical areas  are also important for modulation of ultrasonic vocalisation. Benzodiazepines  e.g. diazepam  inhibit shock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation although the active doses are generally close to those that produce sedation and muscle relaxation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants that preferentially enhance serotonergic neurotransmission inhibit footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation. The 5-HT(2) receptor antagonistic properties of fluoxetine may explain why only partial inhibition is achieved. The biphasic dose-response curve of the racemic drug  citalopram  may perhaps be ascribed to an attenuating effect of R-citalopram. Tricyclic antidepressants  e.g. imipramine  and antidepressants that preferentially enhance catecholaminergic neurotransmission  e.g. reboxetine and venlafaxine  are inactive. Classical antipsychotics like haloperidol have no or a weak inhibitory effect. Serotonin plays a major role in the mediation of ultrasonic vocalisation  and in particular 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2) receptors are found to have a prominent role. Different serotonergic pathways are likely to be involved in the mediation of the anxiolytic-like response  e.g. the pathway ascending from the dorsal raphe nucleus through the medial forebrain bundle to the amygdala and frontal cortex mediating conditioned/learned anxiety and another pathway ascending from the dorsal raphe nucleus to the periaqueductal grey mediating unconditioned/fight flight anxiety. Dopamine D(2) receptor agonists are potent inhibitors of footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation. The role of dopamine D(1) receptors and adrenoceptors remains to be further elucidated. Several other neurotransmitters are involved in the mediation of ultrasonic vocalisation  e.g. acetylcholine  histamine and glutamate. There is also a need for further studies of how changes in stress-axis function may modulate ultrasonic vocalisation and for studies of the effects of chronic drug treatment on ultrasonic vocalisation."

In situ hybridization was carried out to localize PRAX-1 mRNA in the rat brain and revealed a high expression of the transcript in limbic structures such as the CA1 region of the hippocampus  as well as the dentate gyrus  septum  amygdala  and the islands of Calleja. A dense hybridization signal was also observed in the nucleus accumbens  caudate nucleus  olfactory tubercle  pineal gland  and cerebellar cortex. PRAX-1 mRNA expression was largely neuronal; it colocalized with neuron-specific enolase but not glial fibrillary acidic protein. Long-term treatments (21 days) with the neuroleptic haloperidol increased PRAX-1 mRNA expression only in the dentate gyrus  whereas anxiolytic/anticonvulsant diazepam had no effect in any of the hippocampal region studied. Repeated electroconvulsive shock administration significantly enhanced PRAX1 expression in the CA1 subfield and dentate gyrus. Several classes of antidepressant treatment  including serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine)  mixed serotonin- and norepinephrine-uptake inhibitor (imipramine)  and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (iproniazid and tranylcypromine)  shared this effect. Furthermore  the selective nonpeptide NK2 receptor antagonist (S)-N-methyl-N-[4-acetylamino-4-phenylpiperidino)-2-(3 4-dichlorophenyl)butyl]benzamide (SR48968)  which shows an antidepressant profile in animal studies  also enhanced PRAX-1 mRNA expression. These results point to a potential role of PRAX-1 function in the central nervous system and suggest that the up-regulation of PRAX-1 mRNA represents a common action of chronic antidepressant treatment."

"60","12171765","The chronic psychosocial stress paradigm in male tree shrews: evaluation of a novel animal model for depressive disorders.","To improve our knowledge of the causal mechanisms of stress-related disorders such as depression  we need animal models that mirror the situation in patients. One promising model is the chronic psychosocial stress paradigm in male tree shrews  which is based on the territorial behaviour of these animals that can be used to establish naturally occurring challenging situations under experimental control in the laboratory. Co-existence of two males in visual and olfactory contact leads to a stable dominant-subordinate relationship  with subordinates showing distinct stress-induced behavioural and neuroendocrine alterations that are comparable to the symptoms observed during episodes of depression in patients such as constantly elevated circulating glucocorticoid hormones due to a chronic hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. To elucidate whether the chronic psychosocial stress model in tree shrews besides its &quot;face validity&quot; for depression also has &quot;predictive validity&quot;  we treated subordinate tree shrews with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine and found a time-dependent restoration of both endocrine and behavioural parameters. In contrast  the anxiolytic diazepam was ineffective. Although the chronic psychosocial stress model in tree shrews requires further validation  it has sufficient face  predictive  and construct validity to become an interesting non-rodent model for research on the etiology and pathophysiology of depression."

Fluoxetine  bupropion  diazepam and antalarmin all suppressed stress-induced gastric ulceration in male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to four hours of plain immobilization. Antalarmin produced the most pronounced anti-ulcer effect and additionally suppressed the stress-induced colonic hypermotility  mucin depletion  autonomic hyperarousal and struggling behavior. Intraperitoneal CRH administration reproduced the intestinal but not the gastric responses to stress while vagotomy antagonized the stress-induced gastric ulceration but not the intestinal responses. We conclude that brain CRH-R1 and vagal pathways are essential for gastric ulceration to occur in response to stress and that peripheral CRH-R1 mediates colonic hypermotility and mucin depletion in this model. Nonpeptide CRH-R1 antagonists may therefore be prophylactic against stress ulcer in the critically ill and therapeutic for other pathogenetically related gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer disease and irritable bowel syndrome."
"63","11992474","Extended action of MKC-242, a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, on light-induced Per gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in mice.","We reported previously that (S)-5-[3-[(1 4-benzodioxan-2-ylmethyl)amino]propoxy]-1 3-benzodioxole hydrochloride (MKC-242) (3 mg kg(-1)  i.p.)  a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist  accelerated the re-entrainment of hamster wheel-running rhythms to a new 8 hr delayed or advanced light-dark cycle  and also potentiated the phase advance of the wheel-running rhythm produced by light pulses. The molecular mechanism underlying MKC-242-induced potentiation of this phase shift  however  has not yet been elucidated. We examined the effects of MKC-242 on light-induced mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of mice. MKC-242 (5 mg kg(-1)  i.p.) potentiated light-induced mPer1 and mPer2 expression in the SCN of mice housed in constant darkness for 2 days  when mRNA levels were observed 3 hr after light-exposure. More potentiating action of MKC-242 on mPer2 expression in the SCN was observed in mice housed in constant darkness for 9-10 days. This facilitatory action of MKC-242 on mPer1 expression was antagonized by WAY100635  a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor blocker  indicating that MKC-242 activated 5-HT(1A) receptors. Other drugs such as 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (10 mg kg(-1)  i.p.)  paroxetine (10 mg kg(-1)  i.p.)  buspirone (10 mg kg(-1)  i.p.)  and diazepam (10 mg kg(-1)  i.p.) did not display a potentiating action on light-induced mPer1 and mPer2 expression in the SCN. In the behavioral experiments  we found that MKC-242 (5 mg kg(-1)  i.p.) potentiated light-induced phase delays of free-running rhythm in mice. The present results suggest that prolonged increase of mPer1 or mPer2 expression in the SCN by MKC-242 may be involved in the potentiation of photic entrainment by MKC-242 in mice."
"64","11522332","Behavioral and neurochemical changes following predatory stress in mice.","This article had several objectives. First it aimed at investigating the anxiogenic-like behaviors elicited by unavoidable cat exposure and/or cat odor across nine strains of mice (BALB/c  C57BL/6  C3H  CBA  DBA/2  NMRI  NZB  SJL  Swiss) in a modified version of the free-exploration test. The second objective was to investigate possible neurochemical changes following cat exposure in Swiss mice by measuring the turnover of dopamine (DA)  noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) in several brain regions known to be involved in the modulation of emotional processes (hippocampus  hypothalamus and striatum). Finally  the third objective was to examine the effects of anxiolytic drug treatments on the anxiogenic responses elicited by a cat odor (i.e. a feces) in Swiss mice previously exposed to a cat using the free-exploration test. Results from the strain comparison showed that mice could be divided into three distinct groups: two non-reactive strains (NZB and SJL) which were relatively insensitive to predatory exposure and/or odor; five intermediate-reactive strains (Swiss  NMRI  CBA  C3H and BALB/c) which displayed clear anxiogenic-like responses only when exposed to both cat and  subsequently  to feces; and two high reactive strains (C57BL/6 and DBA/2) which showed anxiogenic-like reactions following cat exposure  regardless of the stimulus (clay or feces) present in the free-exploration cage. Neurochemical data revealed that  while brain levels of NA  DA  5-HT in cat exposed Swiss mice were not significantly different from those of control animals  turnover rates of these monoamines were increased in the hippocampus (NA and 5-HT)  hypothalamus and striatum (DA) after cat exposure. Results from pharmacological experiments indicated that repeated administration of the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (5-20 mg/kg  twice a day  for 5 days) completely abolished avoidance of the cat feces in Swiss mice previously exposed to the predator. Neither acute nor repeated administration of the classical anxiolytic diazepam was able to reduce avoidance behavior of the anxiogenic stimulus in the free-exploration test. Taken together  these findings indicate that the exposure of mice to unavoidable predatory stimuli is associated with behavioral and neurochemical changes consistent with increased anxiety."
"65","11166289","Inhibition of shock-induced foot tapping behaviour in the gerbil by a tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist.","The selective tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist  2-(R)-(1-(R)-3 5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(3-oxo-1 2 4-triazol-5-yl)methylmorpholine (MK-869)  has been recently described as a novel therapeutic approach for anxiety/depression. A frequently used model to establish the central nervous system (CNS) activity of tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonists is the inhibition of NK1 agonist-induced foot tapping in gerbils. In the present study  we demonstrate that foot tapping can also be induced in most  but not all  gerbils by footshock and associated cues. MK-869 (0.3-3 mg/kg  i.p.) dose-dependently blocked this foot tapping response. This effect was further shown to be due to selective NK1 receptor blockade  since (2S 3S)-cis-3(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine (CP-99 994; 3 mg/kg  i.p.) inhibited foot tapping  whereas its less active enantiomer (2R 3R)-cis-3(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine (CP-100 263; 3 mg/kg  i.p.) had no effect. Diazepam (1-10 mg/kg  i.p.) also inhibited foot tapping  whereas fluoxetine (10-30 mg/kg  i.p.) markedly increased this behaviour. The present data support the view that foot tapping in the gerbil is a behavioural response to an aversive stimulus  and is robustly inhibited by two NK1 receptor antagonists. The data support a role for tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonists as novel anxiolytic/antidepressants."
"66","11095300","Determination of the antidepressant fluoxetine in human plasma by LC with UV detection.","A selective and sensitive isocratic high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed for the quantitative analysis of low concentrations of fluoxetine (FLX) in human plasma  with ultra-violet detection at 226 nm. A reversed-phase column  LiChrospher 60 RP-Select B (125 x 3 mm i.d.  5 microm) (Merck)  was used to resolve FLX and diazepam (DZP) (internal standard) from endogenous matrix interferences. FLX was isolated from plasma by liquid-liquid extraction. Two identical HPLC systems were used  both validated under the same study conditions. Each chromatographic separation was completed in 30 min and the results showed a mean relative recovery of 101 and 99.3% and an overall precision (RSD%) of 4.78 and 6.09 for each HPLC system. The standard curve was linear for FLX concentrations over the range of 5.00-50.0 ng ml(-1) (R = 0.997 and 0.998). The limit of quantitation of FLX was 5 ng ml(-1) for both HPLC systems. The method described was applied to the analysis of plasma samples obtained from healthy subjects treated with one single oral dose of 40 mg of fluoxetine."
"67","10817541","Some pharmacological properties of new analogs of MP 3022, the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist.","Two new analogs of full 5-HT1A receptor antagonist 4-[3-(1-benzotriazolyl)propyl]-1-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine (MP 3022; 1) containing di- (5) or tetramethylene- (6) spacer were synthesized. In the radioligand binding studies  compounds 5 and 6 showed high 5-HT1A (Ki = 14.7 nM and 11.8 nM  respectively) and low 5-HT2 receptor affinity (Ki = 2 696 nM and 389.2 nM  respectively). In behavioral studies both compounds behaved like postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor antagonists as they reduced lower lip retraction and behavioral syndrome induced by 8-OH-DPAT (5-HT1A receptor agonist) in rats  but 6 was more effective in these tests. Derivative 5 did not affect body temperature in mice  whereas 6 decreased it. Furthermore  5 did not change hypothermia induced by 8-OH-DPAT  and 6-induced lowering of body temperature in mice was not antagonized by (S)-WAY 100135 (5-HT1A antagonist)  so in that model 5 and 6 did not behave as antagonist or agonist  respectively  at presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. Compound 6 was studied in behavioral tests used to predict a potential anxiolytic (conflict drinking test in rats) and antidepressant (forced swimming test in rats) activity. Diazepam and imipramine were used as reference drugs. Compound 6 significantly increased the number of shocks accepted in water-deprived rats in conflict drinking test and shortened the immobility time in forced swimming test in rats. The above findings indicate that new 5-HT1A postsynaptic antagonist 6 behaves like anxiolytic and antidepressant  but mechanisms of these properties of 6 remain unknown."
