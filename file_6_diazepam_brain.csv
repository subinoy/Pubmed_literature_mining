Currently  only one FDA approved antidote exists for BZD overdose and novel approaches are needed to improve management of DZP overdose  dependency and withdrawal.OBJECTIVE: Here  we hypothesized that increasing bioactive lipid mediators termed epoxy fatty acids (EpFAs) will prevent hypotension  as was shown previously in a murine model of LPS-induced hypotension. Therefore  we first characterized the time and dose dependent profile of DZP induced hypotension in mice  and then investigated the reversal of the hypotensive effect by inhibiting the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)  an enzyme that regulates the levels of EpFAs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following baseline systolic BP recording using tail cuffs  mice were administered a sEH inhibitor (TPPU) before DZP and BP was monitored. Blood and brain levels of DZP and TPPU were quantified to examine distribution and metabolism. Plasma EpFAs levels were quantified to determine TPPU target engagement.RESULTS: In this murine model  DZP induced dose dependent hypotension which was more severe than midazolam. The temporal profile was consistent with the reported pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of DZP. Treatment with TPPU reversed the hypotension resulting from high doses of DZP and decreased the sEH metabolites of EpFAs in the plasma demonstrating target engagement.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Overall  these findings demonstrate the similarity of a murine model of DZP induced hypotension to clinical observations in humans. Furthermore  we demonstrate that stabilization of EpFAs by inhibiting sEH is a novel approach to overcome DZP-induced hypotension and this beneficial effect can be enhanced by an omega three diet probably acting through epoxide metabolites of the fatty acids."

Drugs with antioxidant effects or inhibitory actions on PKC may have antimanic effects. The flavonoid quercetin has antioxidant and PKC-inhibiting effects that resemble those of lithium  the first-line treatment for mania in bipolar disorder. We hypothesized that quercetin may have antimanic-like effects in an animal model.MAIN METHODS: In the present study  we investigated the effects of acute and chronic treatment with quercetin (2.5  5  10  and 40mg/kg  i.p.) in male Swiss mice that were subjected to methylphenidate (5mg/kg  i.p.)-induced hyperlocomotion  an animal model of mania. Lithium (100mg/kg  i.p.) and diazepam (5mg/kg  i.p.) were used as positive and negative controls  respectively. We also evaluated the effects of these treatments on methylphenidate-induced oxidative stress in the brain by measuring reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels in the prefrontal cortex  hippocampus  and striatum.KEY FINDINGS: Acute and chronic (21-day) treatment with lithium and diazepam reduced methylphenidate-induced hyperlocomotion. Chronic but not acute treatment with quercetin (10 and 40mg/kg) blocked methylphenidate-induced hyperlocomotion. These effects of lithium and quercetin occurred at doses that did not alter spontaneous locomotor activity  whereas diazepam reduced spontaneous locomotor activity. Chronic treatment with lithium and quercetin blocked the methylphenidate-induced increase in LPO levels in the striatum.SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that chronic quercetin treatment has antimanic-like and antioxidant effects  thus encouraging further studies of quercetin as a putative new antimanic drug."

Seven groups of mice (12-15 g each) were administered distilled water (DW) (non-stressed and stressed controls)  sertraline (10 mg/kg)  diazepam (2 mg/kg) or one of three doses of melatonin (5  10 and 15 mg/kg). Mice were exposed to 30 min of chronic mild stress (25 min of cage shaking  cage tilting  handling and 5 min of forced swimming in tepid warm water at 25 °C  in a random order) after administration of DW or drugs  daily for 21 days. Behavioural assessments were conducted on day 1 and day 21 (after which mice were sacrificed  blood taken for estimation of corticosterone levels and brain homogenates used for estimation of antioxidant activities). Administration of melatonin resulted in an increase in horizontal locomotion and self-grooming  while rearing showed a time-dependent increase  compared to non-stress and stress controls. Working memory improved with increasing doses of melatonin (compared to controls and diazepam); in comparison to setraline however  working memory decreased. A dose-related anxiolytic effect is seen when melatonin is compared to non-stressed and stressed controls. Melatonin administration reduced the systemic/oxidant response to repeated stress. Administration of melatonin in repeatedly stressed adolescent mice was associated with improved central excitation  enhancement of working memory  anxiolysis and reduced systemic response to stress."

Nevertheless  many patients undergoing PET studies are likely to be under chronic treatment with benzodiazepines  for example due to the use of different medications such as sleeping pills. Animal studies may provide an extensive and accurate estimation of the effect of benzodiazepines on brain metabolism in a well-defined and controlled framework.AIM: This study aims at evaluating the impact of benzodiazepines on brain FDG uptake after single-dose administration and chronic treatment in rats.METHODS: Twelve Sprague-Dawley healthy rats were randomly divided into two groups  one treated with diazepam and the other used as control group. Both groups underwent PET/CT examinations after single-dose and chronic administration of diazepam (treated) or saline (controls) during twenty-eight days. Different atlas-based quantification methods were used to explore differences on the total uptake and uptake patterns of FDG between both groups.RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a significant reduction of global FDG uptake after acute (-16.2%) and chronic (-23.2%) administration of diazepam. Moreover  a strong trend pointing to differences between acute and chronic administrations (p&lt;0.08) was also observed. Uptake levels returned to normal after interrupting the administration of diazepam. On the other hand  patterns of FDG uptake were not affected by the administration of diazepam.CONCLUSIONS: The administration of diazepam causes a progressive decrease of the FDG global uptake in the rat brain  but it does not change local patterns within the brain. Under these conditions  visual assessment and quantification methods based on regional differences such as asymmetry indexes or SPM statistical analysis would still be valid when administrating this medication."

We have previously shown that myoinositol (MI) daily treatment for 28 days prevents certain biochemical changes that are triggered by kainic acid (KA) induced status epilepticus (SE). However in these studies we have not detected any effects of MI on the first day after SE. In the present study we broadened our research and focused on other molecular and morphological changes at the early stages of SE induced by KA and effects of MI treatment on these changes. The increase in the amount of voltage-dependent anionic channel-1 (VDAC-1)  cofilin  and caspase-3 activity was observed in the hippocampus of KA treated rats. Administration of MI 4 hours later after KA treatment abolishes these changes  whereas diazepam treatment by the same time schedule has no significant influence. The number of neuronal cells in CA1 and CA3 subfields of hippocampus is decreased after KA induced SE and MI posttreatment significantly attenuates this reduction. No significant changes are observed in the neocortex. Obtained results indicate that MI posttreatment after KA induced SE could successfully target the biochemical processes involved in apoptosis  reduces cell loss  and can be successfully used in the future for translational research."

Intraperitonial administration of pilocarpine (85mg/kg) induced seizure in mice was assessed by behavior observations  which is significantly (p&gt;0.05) reduced by apigenin 8-C-glucoside (AP8CG) (10mg/kg) and chlorogenic acid (CA) (5mg/kg)  similar to diazepam. Seizure was accompanied by an imbalance in the levels of Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in the pilocarpine administered group. Moreover  convulsion along with reduced acetylcholinesterase  increased monoamine oxidase and oxidative stress was observed in epileptic mice brain. AP8CG and CA significantly restored back to normal levels even at lower doses. Further  increased lipid peroxidation and nitrite content was also significantly attenuated by AP8CG and CA. However  CA was found to be more effective when compared to AP8CG. In addition  the mRNA expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)  mGluR1 and mGlu5 was significantly (P=0.05) inhibited by AP8CG and CA in a lower dose. The mRNA expression of GRIK1 did not differ significantly in any of the group and showed a similar pattern of expression. Our result shows that AP8CG and CA selectively inhibit NMDAR  mGluR1 and mGlu5 expression. Modification in the provoked NMDAR calcium response coupled with neuronal death. Hence  these findings underline that the polyphenolics  AP8CG and CA have exerted antiepileptic and neuroprotective activity by suppressing glutamate receptors."
"7","27397490","A review of intranasal formulations for the treatment of seizure emergencies.","Epileptic seizure emergencies are life-threatening conditions  which in their most severe form  status epilepticus  have a high mortality rate if not quickly terminated. Treatment requires rapid delivery of anti-epileptics such as benzodiazepines to the brain. The nasal route is attractive due to its non-invasiveness  potential for direct nose to brain delivery  high vascularity  relatively large absorptive surface area  and avoidance of intestinal/liver metabolism. However  the limited volume of the nasal cavity and poor water solubility of anti-epileptics restrict absorption  leading to insufficient therapeutic brain levels. This review covers various formulation approaches adopted to improve nasal delivery of drugs  especially benzodiazepines  used to treat seizure emergencies. Other general topics such as nasal anatomy  challenges to nasal delivery  and drug/formulation considerations for nose to brain delivery are also discussed."

Various anti-depressant drugs have been used to provide succour to this ailment  but with little success and rather have resulted in many side effects. On the other hand  low dose of ionizing radiations are reported to exhibit many beneficial effects on human body by stimulating various biological processes. The present study was conducted to investigate the beneficial effects of low doses of X-rays  if any  during diazepam induced depression in rats. Female Sprague Dawley rats were segregated into four different groups viz: Normal control  Diazepam treated  X-irradiated and Diazepam + X-irradiated. Depression model was created in rats by subjecting them to diazepam treatment at a dosage of 2 mg/kg b.wt./day for 3 weeks. The skulls of animals belonging to X-irradiated and Diazepam + X-irradiated rats were X-irradiated with a single fraction of 0.5 Gy  given twice a day for 3 days  thereby delivered dose of 3 Gy. Diazepam treated animals showed significant alterations in the neurobehavior and neuro-histoarchitecture  which were improved after X-irradiation. Further  diazepam exposure significantly decreased the levels of neurotransmitters and acetylcholinesterase activity  but increased the monoamine oxidase activity in brain. Interestingly  X-rays exposure to diazepam treated rats increased the levels of neurotransmitters  acetylcholinesterase activity and decreased the monoamine oxidase activity. Further  depressed rats also showed increased oxidative stress with altered antioxidant parameters  which were normalized on X-rays exposure. The present study  suggests that low dose of ionizing radiations  shall prove to be an effective intervention and a novel therapy in controlling depression and possibly other brain related disorders."
"9","27111380","Acute Administration of Diazepam Provokes Redox Homeostasis Imbalance in the Rat Brain: Prevention by Simvastatin.","We investigated the effects of acute diazepam (DZP) administration on thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels  protein carbonyl content  and on the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase  glutathione peroxidase  and superoxide dismutase in the brain of rats. Additionally  we investigated the antioxidant role of chronic pretreatment with simvastatin on the effects provoked by DZP. Simvastatin was administered (1 or 10 mg/kg by oral gavage) for 30 days. On the 30th day of treatment  groups were randomized and DZP was administered (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection). Control groups received saline. Results showed that DZP enhanced TBARS levels and protein carbonyl content and altered enzymatic activity in the brain of rats. Simvastatin prevented most of the alterations caused by DZP on the oxidative stress parameters. Data indicate that DZP administration causes an oxidative imbalance in the brain areas studied; however  in the presence of simvastatin  some of these alterations in oxidative stress were prevented."

In mouse  intraperitoneal treatment with 75<U+2009>mg/kg GLA generates repetitive tonic-clonic seizures associated with 100% mortality within 72<U+2009>h after treatment. In this context  we characterized GLA-induced seizures  their histological consequences and the effectiveness of diazepam treatment. Epileptic discharges on electroencephalographic recordings appeared simultaneously in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. Diazepam treatment at 6<U+2009>h immediately stopped the seizures and prevented animal death. However  intermittent seizures were recorded on electroencephalogram from 6<U+2009>h after diazepam treatment until 24<U+2009>h  but had disappeared after 15 days. In our model  neuronal activation (c-Fos immunohistochemistry) was observed 6<U+2009>h after GLA exposure in the dentate gyrus  CA1  CA3  amygdala  piriform and entorhinal cortices  indicating the activation of the limbic system. In these structures  Fluoro-Jade C and Cresyl violet staining did not show neuronal suffering. However  astroglial activation was clearly observed at 24<U+2009>h and 15 days after GLA treatment in the amygdala  piriform and entorhinal cortices by PCR quantitative  western blot and immunohistochemistry. Concomitantly  glutamine synthetase mRNA expression (PCR quantitative)  protein expression (western blot) and enzymatic activity were upregulated. In conclusion  our study suggests that GLA-induced seizures: (a) involved limbic structures and (b) induced astrocytosis without neuronal degeneration as an evidence of a reactive astrocyte beneficial effect for neuronal protection."
"11","27020741","Ancient Anxiety Pathways Influence Drosophila Defense Behaviors.","Anxiety helps us anticipate and assess potential danger in ambiguous situations [1-3]; however  the anxiety disorders are the most prevalent class of psychiatric illness [4-6]. Emotional states are shared between humans and other animals [7]  as observed by behavioral manifestations [8]  physiological responses [9]  and gene conservation [10]. Anxiety research makes wide use of three rodent behavioral assays-elevated plus maze  open field  and light/dark box-that present a choice between sheltered and exposed regions [11]. Exposure avoidance in anxiety-related defense behaviors was confirmed to be a correlate of rodent anxiety by treatment with known anxiety-altering agents [12-14] and is now used to characterize anxiety systems. Modeling anxiety with a small neurogenetic animal would further aid the elucidation of its neuronal and molecular bases. Drosophila neurogenetics research has elucidated the mechanisms of fundamental behaviors and implicated genes that are often orthologous across species. In an enclosed arena  flies stay close to the walls during spontaneous locomotion [15  16]  a behavior proposed to be related to anxiety [17]. We tested this hypothesis with manipulations of the GABA receptor  serotonin signaling  and stress. The effects of these interventions were strikingly concordant with rodent anxiety  verifying that these behaviors report on an anxiety-like state. Application of this method was able to identify several new fly anxiety genes. The presence of conserved neurogenetic pathways in the insect brain identifies Drosophila as an attractive genetic model for the study of anxiety and anxiety-related disorders  complementing existing rodent systems."

GLP-1 has been reported to maintain hyperexcitability of neurons. Therefore  this study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of liraglutide  GLP-1 analogue in PTZ kindling epilepsy-induced comorbidities and neurochemical alteration in mice. Male albino mice were administered PTZ (35 mg/kg) on every alternate day up to 29th days and challenge test was performed on 33rd day. From 1st day liraglutide (75 and 150 µg/kg) and diazepam (3 mg/kg) were administered up to 33rd day  30 min prior to PTZ treatment. On 30th day animals were trained on elevated plus maze and passive shock avoidance paradigm and retention was recorded on 31st and 33rd day. On 32nd day tail suspension test was performed. Animals were sacrificed on 34th day for biochemical (LPO  GSH  and nitrite) and neurotransmitters (GABA  glutamate  DA  NE  5-HT and their metabolites) estimation. Chronic treatment with PTZ developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures  reduced cognitive skills  increased oxidative stress and alteration in the level of neurotransmitters. Pre-treatment with liraglutide (75 and 150 µg/kg) significantly prevented the seizure severity  restored behavioural activity  oxidative defence enzymes  and altered level of neurochemicals in mice brain. The protective effect of liraglutide is attributed to restoration of altered level of GABA  glutamate  DA  NE  and 5-HT by the up-regulation of GLP-1Rs in mice brain."
"13","26930498","Positive Allosteric Modulator of GABA Lowers BOLD Responses in the Cingulate Cortex.","Knowledge about the neural underpinnings of the negative blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is still limited. We hypothesized that pharmacological GABAergic modulation attenuates BOLD responses  and that blood concentrations of a positive allosteric modulator of GABA correlate inversely with BOLD responses in the cingulate cortex. We investigated whether or not pure task-related negative BOLD responses were co-localized with pharmacologically modulated BOLD responses. Twenty healthy adults received either 5 mg diazepam or placebo in a double blind  randomized design. During fMRI the subjects performed a working memory task. Results showed that BOLD responses in the cingulate cortex were inversely correlated with diazepam blood concentrations; that is  the higher the blood diazepam concentration  the lower the BOLD response. This inverse correlation was most pronounced in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. For subjects with diazepam plasma concentration &gt; 0.1 mg/L we observed negative BOLD responses with respect to fixation baseline. There was minor overlap between cingulate regions with task-related negative BOLD responses and regions where the BOLD responses were inversely correlated with diazepam concentration. We interpret that the inverse correlation between the BOLD response and diazepam was caused by GABA-related neural inhibition. Thus  this study supports the hypothesis that GABA attenuates BOLD responses in fMRI. The minimal overlap between task-related negative BOLD responses and responses attenuated by diazepam suggests that these responses might be caused by different mechanisms."
"14","26926965","Impaired synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex of mice with developmentally decreased number of interneurons.","Interneurons are inhibitory neurons  which protect neural tissue from excessive excitation. They are interconnected with glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex and regulate their function. Particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)  interneurons have been strongly implicated in regulating pathological states which display deficits in the PFC. The aim of this study is to investigate the adaptations in the adult glutamatergic system  when defects in interneuron development do not allow adequate numbers of interneurons to reach the cerebral cortex. To this end  we used a mouse model that displays ~50% fewer cortical interneurons due to the Rac1 protein loss from Nkx2.1/Cre expressing cells (Rac1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice)  to examine how the developmental loss of interneurons may affect basal synaptic transmission  synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphology in the adult PFC. Despite the decrease in the number of interneurons  basal synaptic transmission  as examined by recording field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) from layer II networks  is not altered in the PFC of Rac1 cKO mice. However  there is decreased paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and decreased long-term potentiation (LTP)  in response to tetanic stimulation  in the layer II PFC synapses of Rac1 cKO mice. Furthermore  expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subunits is decreased and dendritic morphology is altered  changes that could underlie the decrease in LTP in the Rac1 cKO mice. Finally  we find that treating Rac1 cKO mice with diazepam in early postnatal life can reverse changes in dendritic morphology observed in non-treated Rac1 cKO mice. Therefore  our data show that disruption in GABAergic inhibition alters glutamatergic function in the adult PFC  an effect that could be reversed by enhancement of GABAergic function during an early postnatal period."
"15","26921854","Single dose efficacy evaluation of two partial benzodiazepine receptor agonists in photosensitive epilepsy patients: A placebo-controlled pilot study.","Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are highly effective to suppress various types of seizures; however  their clinical use is limited due to adverse effects and tolerance and dependence liability. Drugs that act only as partial agonists at the BZD recognition site (initially termed &quot;BZD receptor&quot;) of the GABAA receptor chloride ionophore complex or exhibit a GABAA receptor subtype-selectivity are thought to have advantages vs. full agonists such as diazepam and most other clinically used BZDs in that such compounds have less adverse effects and reduced or absent tolerance and dependence liability. One of such compounds  abecarnil  has been clinically evaluated as a novel anxiolytic drug  but  despite its potent preclinical anti-seizure activity  it has not yet been evaluated in patients with epilepsy. In the present proof-of-concept study  we performed a within-subject placebo-controlled  single oral dose study of abecarnil in patients with photosensitive epilepsy. Flumazenil  which is generally considered a BZD receptor antagonist  but has slight partial agonistic properties  was used for comparison. In total  12 patients were enrolled in this study. Abecarnil  5 or 10mg  completely abolished the photo-paroxysmal EEG response  while flumazenil  30  60 or 100mg  was less effective. The anti-epileptic effect of abecarnil was significantly different from both placebo and flumazenil. Sedative adverse effects were observed after abecarnil but not flumazenil. The study substantiates previous pre-clinical experiments that abecarnil exerts pronounced anti-seizure activity. Epilepsy is often associated with anxiety  so that the anxiolytic activity of abecarnil would be an added advantage when using this compound in epilepsy patients."

The central nucleus of the amygdala is often called the 'nociceptive amygdala'  but little is known about the role of the basolateral amygdala. Here  we monitored the mechanical nociceptive thresholds in a mouse model of neuropathic pain and infused modulators of the glutamate/GABAergic transmission in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) via chronically-implanted cannulas. We found that an N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor antagonist (MK-801) exerted a potent antiallodynic effect  whereas a transient allodynia was induced after perfusion of bicuculline  a GABA(A) receptor antagonist. Potentiating GABA(A) receptor function using diazepam or etifoxine (a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic) fully but transiently alleviated mechanical allodynia. Interestingly  the antiallodynic effect of etifoxine disappeared in animals that were incapable of producing 3a-steroids. Diazepam had a similar effect but of shorter duration. As indicated by patch-clamp recordings of BLA neurons  these effects were mediated by a potentiation of GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Together with a presynaptic elevation of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current frequency  the duration and amplitude of GABA(A) miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents were also increased (postsynaptic effect). The analgesic contribution of endogenous neurosteroid seemed to be exclusively postsynaptic. This study highlights the importance of the BLA and the local inhibitory/excitatory neuronal network activity while setting the mechanical nociceptive threshold. Furthermore  it appears that promoting inhibition in this specific nucleus could fully alleviate pain symptoms. Therefore  the BLA could be a novel interesting target for the development of pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies."

The present study was aimed at investigating the antiepileptogenic effect of borneol in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling besides its ability to suppress oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory marker  glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Repeated administration of a subconvulsive dose of PTZ (35 mg/kg  i.p.) on every alternate day for 4 weeks produced kindling in mice. Borneol (5  10  and 25 mg/kg  i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg  i.p.) were given as a pretreatment prior to each PTZ injection during the progression of kindling. Oxidative stress parameters such as superoxide dismutase (SOD)  reduced glutathione (GSH)  catalase (CAT)  and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were assessed at the end of the study. Neuronal damage was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining technique. GFAP was also evaluated in the hippocampus region of the brain by using immunohistochemistry. Borneol significantly suppressed the process of epileptogenesis in PTZ-kindled mice. The biochemical alterations induced by PTZ kindling were ameliorated in borneol-treated animals which was indicated by decreased LPO and increased SOD  GSH  CAT levels. The distinct neuronal damage observed in the kindled group was counteracted by borneol. Furthermore  it decreased the levels of GFAP which was manifested by reduced immunostaining. The above results are suggestive of the antiepileptogenic potential of borneol in the PTZ-induced kindling model of epilepsy  and thus  it could be a prospective molecule in the treatment of epilepsy."

In this report  we provide converging evidence indicating that a splice variant isoform of the Acbd7 mRNA is expressed and translated by some POMC and GABAergic-neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). We have demonstrated that the ARC ACBD7 isoform was produced and processed into a bioactive peptide referred to as nonadecaneuropeptide (NDN) in response to catabolic signals. We have characterized NDN as a potent anorexigenic signal acting through an uncharacterized endozepine G protein-coupled receptor and subsequently via the melanocortin system. Our results suggest that ACBD7-producing neurons participate in the hypothalamic leptin signalling pathway. Taken together  these data suggest that ACBD7-producing neurons are involved in the hypothalamic control exerted on food intake and energy expenditure by the leptin-melanocortin pathway."
"19","26862749","Sustained Effects of Developmental Exposure to Ethanol on Zebrafish Anxiety-Like Behaviour.","In zebrafish developmentally exposed to ambient ethanol (20mM-50mM) 1-9 days post fertilization (dpf)  the cortisol response to stress has been shown to be significantly attenuated in larvae  juveniles and 6 month old adults. These data are somewhat at variance with similar studies in mammals  which often show heightened stress responses. To test whether these cortisol data correlate with behavioural changes in treated animals  anxiety-like behaviour of zebrafish larvae (9dpf and 10dpf) and juveniles (23dpf) was tested in locomotor assays designed to this end. In open field tests treated animals were more exploratory  spending significantly less time at the periphery of the arena. Behavioural effects of developmental exposure to ethanol were sustained in 6-month-old adults  as judged by assessment of thigmotaxis  novel tank diving and scototaxis. Like larvae and juveniles  developmentally treated adults were generally more exploratory  and spent less time at the periphery of the arena in thigmotaxis tests  less time at the bottom of the tank in the novel tank diving tests  and less time in the dark area in scototaxis tests. The conclusion that ethanol-exposed animals showed less anxiety-like behaviour was validated by comparison with the effects of diazepam treatment  which in thigmotaxis and novel tank diving tests had similar effects to ethanol pretreatment. There is thus a possible link between the hypophyseal-pituitary-interrenal axis and the behavioural actions of developmental ethanol exposure. The mechanisms require further elucidation."

After long period of exposure to stressors  including restrained stress  depressive-like behavior can be produced. BEO has been suggested to reduce depression. However  there is no scientific evidence supporting this property.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of BEO in chronic stressed rats on: 1) behavior related depressive disorder  2) hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response  and iii) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels in hippocampus.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Male Wistar rats  weighing 200 to 250 g  were induced chronic restrained stress 15 minutes dailyfor two weeks. For the next two weeks  these rats were divided intofour groups  control-i.p.  fluoxetine-i.p.  control-inhale  and BEO-inhale. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg i.p.) or saline was intraperitoneally administered daily while 2.5% BEO or saline was inhaled daily. At the end of the treatment  rats were assessed for depressive-like behavior using the forced swimming test (FST). After the behavioral test  the animals were immediately decapitated and trunk blood samples were collected for the measurement ofcorticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels and hippocampus was dissected and stored in afreezer at -80 °C until assay for BDNF protein.RESULTS: BEO andfluoxetine significantly decreased the immobility time in the FST (p &lt; 0.05). Fluoxetine tended to decrease serum corticosterone and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased serum ACTH while BEO had no effect on these two stress hormones. For BDNF protein determination  neither BEO norfluoxetine had any effect on BDNF protein levels in hippocampus compared to their controls.CONCLUSION: The inhalation ofBEO decrease behavior related depressive disorder similar tofluoxetine but has no effect on HPA axis response and BDNF protein levels in chronic restrained stress."

The positive controls antipyrine  caffeine  diazepam  and propranolol showed mean endothelial permeability coefficients (P e) in the range of 17-70<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-6) cm/s  indicating moderate to high BBB permeability when compared to the barrier integrity marker sodium fluorescein (mean P e 3-5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-6) cm/s). The negative controls atenolol  cimetidine  and vinblastine showed mean P e values<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>10<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-6) cm/s  suggesting low permeability. In silico calculations were in agreement with in vitro data. With the exception of quinidine (P-glycoprotein inhibitor and substrate)  BBB permeability of all control compounds was correctly predicted by this new  easy  and fast to set up human in vitro BBB model. Addition of retinoic acid and puromycin did not increase transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values of the BBB model."

However  it was unclear if this neuroprotective effect is a consequence of the decrease in the glutamate release. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of TFS on <U+03B3>-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate release in the hippocampus during pilocarpine-induced SE. After pilocarpine administration  the rats showed progressive behavioral changes that culminated in SE with a significant increase of GABA and glutamate (95 and 128% respectively)  even more evident at the end of the experiment (120 and 182% respectively)  5 hours after pilocarpine injection and was associated with the prevalence of high-voltage rhythmic spikes and increased spectral power in the 4-90 Hz bands. The TFS application during the SE decreased the convulsive expression  the prevalence of high-voltage rhythmic spikes and spectral power in 4-8 Hz and 30-90 Hz bands. These effects were associated with lower release of GABA and glutamate in the hippocampus. These results support the anticonvulsive and neuroprotective effects induced by TFS."

Glu is synthesized by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH  E.C. 1.4.1.3) and dysfunction of the enzymatic activity of GDH is associated with brain pathologies. The main goal of this work is to establish the role of GDH in the effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as valproate (VALP)  diazepam (DIAZ) and diphenylhydantoin (DPH) and its repercussions on oxygen consumption. Oxidative deamination of Glu and reductive amination of aketoglutarate (aK) in mice brain were investigated. Our results show that AEDs decrease GDH activity and oxygen consumption in vitro. In ex vivo experiments  AEDs increased GDH activity but decreased oxygen consumption during Glu oxidative deamination. VALP and DPH reversed the increase in reductive amination of aK caused by the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazol. These results suggest that AEDs act by modulating brain GDH activity  which in turn decreased oxygen consumption. GDH represents an important regulation point of neuronal excitability  and modulation of its activity represents a potential target for metabolic treatment of epilepsy and for the development of new AEDs."

[(11)C]flumazenil binding was measured in five discrete brain structures  namely the caudate putamen  hippocampus  cerebellum  occipital cortex and parietal cortex. As expected  diazepam injection produced a significant decrease in [(11)C]flumazenil binding  which was interpreted as benzodiazepine GABA-A receptor occupancy  whereas etifoxine increased the binding of [(11)C]flumazenil. This first use of in vivo imaging after etifoxine administration revealed the activated binding pattern of [(11)C]flumazenil and highlighted the pharmacological differences between etifoxine and benzodiazepines. Using the same [(11)C]flumazenil radiotracer  PET neuroimaging could be applied to larger animals and  ultimately  to human subjects  thus providing new perspectives for better defining the molecular pharmacology of etifoxine."

We induced SE in young rats and treated with either vehicle or RESV  commencing an hour after SE induction and continuing every hour for three-hours on SE day and twice daily thereafter for 3 days. Seizures were terminated in both groups two-hours after SE with a diazepam injection. In contrast to the vehicle-treated group  the hippocampus of animals receiving RESV during and after SE presented no loss of glutamatergic neurons in hippocampal cell layers  diminished loss of inhibitory interneurons expressing parvalbumin  somatostatin and neuropeptide Y in the dentate gyrus  reduced aberrant neurogenesis with preservation of reelin<U+2009>+<U+2009>interneurons  lowered concentration of oxidative stress byproduct malondialdehyde and pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha  normalized expression of oxidative stress responsive genes and diminished numbers of activated microglia.

We have previously described a significant diminution in the GABAergic regulation of glutamate release from synaptosomes of EAE rats isolated during the acute stage of the disease. In order to explore the possible metabolic pathways responsible for this alteration  in this work we evaluate the direct effect of different GABAergic agonists on the glutamate release and concomitant synapsin I phosphorylation in synaptosomes from the frontal cortex of control and EAE animals. The results show that GABA as well as the GABA receptor agonists Muscimol (GABAA agonist) and Baclofen (GABAB agonist) caused a decrease in glutamate release in control rats paralleled by a similar reduction in synapsin I phosphorylation. Meanwhile synaptosomes from EAE animals are responsive only to Baclofen with respect to nontreated EAE synaptosomes  since glutamate release from the synaptosomes treated with Muscimol was similar to that observed in EAE rat synaptosomes which was already reduced as consequence of the disease. In the case of the benzodiazepines Diazepam and Clonazepam (GABAA allosteric agonists)  both of them induced a reduction in glutamate release in synaptosomes from the CFA rats  effect that was only observed in synaptosomes of EAE rats treated with Clonazepam. In all cases both benzodiazepines showed a higher effect on synapsin I phosphorylation than in glutamate release. These results indicate that the extent of GABAergic modulation of presynaptic terminals depends on the type of agonist employed and this regulation is altered in the frontal cortex during the acute phase of EAE with respect to control animals."

Modulation of GABAA receptors may therefore represent a novel drug-class independent mechanism for the development of abuse treatment pharmacotherapeutics.OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that the GABAA receptor benzodiazepine-site (BDZ) negative modulator Ro15-4513 would reduce the reward-related effects of three pharmacologically dissimilar drugs; toluene vapor  d-methamphetamine  and diazepam using intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) in mice. We also examined whether Ro15-4513 attenuated dopamine release produced by d-methamphetamine in an in vivo microdialysis procedure.RESULTS: Ro15-4513 abolished ICSS reward facilitation produced by all three abused drugs at Ro15-4513 doses which had no effect on ICSS when administered alone. In contrast  the BDZ antagonist flumazenil only attenuated the ICSS-facilitating effects of diazepam. Administration of the same dose of Ro15-4513 which abolished drug-facilitated ICSS produced a 58 % decrease in d-methamphetamine-stimulated dopamine in the nucleus accumbens of mice relative to d-methamphetamine alone.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that negative modulation of GABAA receptors can produce profound reductions in reward-related effects of a diverse group of drugs that activate the mesolimbic reward pathway through different mechanisms. These data suggest that pharmacological modulation of GABAA receptors may represent a viable pathway for the development of drug abuse pharmacotherapies."

Calcium-free perfusion also decreased ATP levels which were  however  not affected by neostigmine or TTX. During status epilepticus  ACh levels were increased threefold but returned to baseline after the termination of seizures by diazepam.

However  only limited data are available on the dynamic changes that occur in myelinated fibers  oligodendrocytes (which are myelin-forming cells)  and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs)  which are a reservoir of new oligodendrocytes  in the hippocampus throughout epileptogenesis. The current study was designed to examine this issue using a rat model of lithium-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. Electroencephalography (EEG)  immunofluorescence  and Western blot analysis showed that the loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes in the rat hippocampus began during the acute stage of epileptogenesis  and the severity of this loss increased throughout epileptogenesis. Accompanying this loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes  OPCs in the rat hippocampus became activated and their populations increased during several phases of epileptogenesis (the acute  latent and chronic phases). The transcription factors olig1 and olig2  which play crucial roles in regulating OPC proliferation  differentiation and remyelination  were up-regulated during the early phases (the acute and latent phases) followed by a sharp decline in their expression during the chronic and late chronic phases. This study is the first to confirm the loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes during lithium-pilocarpine-induced epileptogenesis accompanied by a transient increase in the number of OPCs. Prevention of the loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes may provide a novel treatment strategy for epilepsy."
"30","26391922","Tolerance to the sedative and anxiolytic effects of diazepam is associated with different alterations of GABAA receptors in rat cerebral cortex.","The clinical use of benzodiazepines is limited by the development of tolerance to their pharmacological effects. Tolerance to each of the pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines develops at different rates. The aim of this work was to investigate the mechanism of tolerance by performing behavioral tests in combination with biochemical studies. To this end  we administered prolonged treatments of diazepam to rats for 7 or 14 days. Tolerance to the sedative effects of diazepam was detected by means of the open field test after the 7- and 14-day treatments  whereas tolerance to the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepine manifested following only the 14-day treatment in the elevated plus maze. The cerebral cortical concentrations of diazepam did not decline after the diazepam treatments  indicating that tolerance was not due to alterations in pharmacokinetic factors. The uncoupling of GABA/benzodiazepine site interactions and an increase in the degree of phosphorylation of the GABAA receptor <U+03B3>2 subunit at serine 327 in the cerebral cortex were produced by day 7 of diazepam treatment and persisted after 14 days of exposure to benzodiazepine. Thus  these alterations could be part of the mechanism of tolerance to the sedative effects of diazepam. An increase in the percentage of a1-containing GABAA receptors in the cerebral cortex was observed following the 14-day treatment with diazepam but not the 7-day treatment  suggesting that tolerance to the anxiolytic effects is associated with a change in receptor subunit composition. The understanding of the molecular bases of tolerance could be important for the development of new drugs that maintain their efficacies over long-term treatments."

Uncontrolled seizures may exacerbate brain injury and contribute to later-life neurological disability. Therefore  it is critical to develop a treatment for neonatal seizures that is effective and safe. In early-life  when the <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory system is not fully developed  potassium channels play an important role in controlling excitability. An earlier study demonstrated that flupirtine  a KCNQ potassium channel opener  is more efficacious than diazepam and phenobarbital for the treatment of chemoconvulsant-induced neonatal seizures. In newborns  seizures are most commonly associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Thus  in the present study  we examined the efficacy of flupirtine to treat neonatal seizures in an animal model of global hypoxia. Our results showed that flupirtine dose dependently blocks the occurrence of behavioral seizures in pups during hypoxia. Additionally  flupirtine inhibits the development of hypoxia-induced clinical seizures and associated epileptiform discharges  as well as purely electrographic (subclinical) seizures. These results suggest that flupirtine is an effective anti-seizure drug  and that further studies should be conducted to determine the time window within which it's administration can effectively treat neonatal seizures."
"32","26365376","Early metabolic responses to lithium/pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in rat brain.","The lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus is a well-known animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. We combined this model with in vivo microdialysis to investigate energy metabolites and acute cellular membrane damage during seizure development. Rats were implanted with dialysis probes and pretreated with lithium chloride (127 mg/kg i.p.). Twenty-four hours later  they received pilocarpine (30 mg/kg s.c.) which initiated seizures within 30 min. In the dialysate from rat hippocampus  we observed a transient increase in glucose and a prominent  five-fold increase in lactate during seizures. Lactate release was because of neuronal activation as it was strongly reduced by infusion of tetrodotoxin  administration of atropine or when seizures were terminated by diazepam or ketamine. In ex vivo assays  mitochondrial function as measured by respirometry was not affected by 90 min of seizures. Extracellular levels of choline  however  increased two-fold and glycerol levels 10-fold  which indicate cellular phospholipid breakdown during seizures. Within 60 min of pilocarpine administration  hydroxylation of salicylate increased two-fold and formation of isoprostanes 20-fold  revealing significant oxidative stress in hippocampal tissue. Increases in lactate  glycerol and isoprostanes were abrogated  and increases in choline were completely prevented  when hippocampal probes were perfused with calcium-free solution. Similarly  administration of pregabalin (100 mg/kg i.p.)  a calcium channel ligand  15 min prior to pilocarpine strongly attenuated parameters of membrane damage and oxidative stress. We conclude that seizure development in a rat model of status epilepticus is accompanied by increases in extracellular lactate  choline and glycerol  and by oxidative stress  while mitochondrial function remains intact for at least 90 min. Membrane damage depends on calcium influx and can be prevented by treatment with pregabalin. Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in rats by lithium-pilocarpine ('Pilo') administration  and extracellular metabolites were measured by microdialysis. Seizures caused several-fold increases in lactate levels which were attenuated by diazepam ('Diaz')  ketamine  atropine and tetrodotoxin (TTX). Indicators of oxidative stress and membrane damage were also increased during seizures. Omission of calcium and pregabalin  a calcium channel blocker  reduced cellular damage induced by SE."

They are known to increase brain levels of catecholamines  likely via reversal of reuptake transporters. However  other mechanisms could also contribute to increased neurotransmitter levels  e.g.  reduced inhibitory inputs on catecholaminergic neurons. Inhibition of the main inhibitory input in the brain  the GABAergic system  by piperazine derivatives could contribute to increased neurotransmitter levels. Our previous studies support this by demonstrating that 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (3CPP/mCPP) is an antagonist of the human a1ß2<U+03B3>2 GABAA receptor (GABAA-R). We therefore investigated the effect of 12 additional piperazine derivatives on the function of the human a1ß2<U+03B3>2 GABAA-R expressed in Xenopus oocytes  using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Tested derivatives included benzylpiperazine (BZP)  methylbenzylpiperazines (2/3MBP)  phenylpiperazine (PP)  methoxyphenylpiperazines (2/3/4MPP/MeOPP)  chlorophenylpiperazines (2/4CPP) and fluorophenylpiperazines (4FPP/TFMPP). All derivatives concentration-dependently inhibited the GABA-evoked ion current. Chlorophenylpiperazines were the most potent GABAA-R antagonists; the IC20 value for 1-(2-chlorophenyl)piperazine (2CPP) was 46µM and 2CPP induced a maximum inhibition of ~ 90% at 1mM. Derivatives can be ranked as follows from highest to lowest potency based on IC20 values: 2CPP&gt;3MPP&gt;4CPP&gt;4MPP&gt;2MBP&gt;3CPP&gt;PP&gt;4FPP&gt;2MPP&gt;TFMPP&gt;3MBP&gt;BZP. This study demonstrates a novel mode of action of piperazine derivatives  i.e.  antagonism of the GABAA-R. This mechanism can result in increased catecholamine levels that indirectly contribute to toxicity  e.g.  adverse effects during overdoses. Therefore  this important mode of action is not only relevant for therapeutic psychiatric interventions  but could also proof valuable for therapeutic interventions in intoxications."

However  ARHGAP26 is also expressed in some hippocampal neurons. Moreover  some of the previously reported patients showed cognitive and affective symptoms. It is unknown whether those symptoms reflected involvement of the limbic system or were part of the so-called cerebellar cognitive/affective syndrome.CASE REPORT: Here  we report a newly diagnosed anti-Ca/ARHGAP26-IgG-positive patient who presented with recurrent psychotic symptoms but no cerebellar ataxia.

The surface expression of <U+03B3>2 subunit-containing GABAA Rs was assessed using a biotinylation assay  and GABAA R-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques from dentate granule cells in hippocampal slices acutely obtained 60 min after seizure onset (SE-treated). The effect of the protein phosphatase inhibitors FK506 and okadaic acid (OA) on the surface expression of these receptors was determined in organotypic slice cultures exposed to high potassium and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) or in SE-treated slices.RESULTS: Diazepam terminated seizures of 3 min but not 60 min duration  even at the highest dose. In the SE-treated slices  the surface expression of <U+03B3>2 subunit-containing GABAA Rs was reduced and the amplitude of the mIPSCs was diminished. Inhibition of protein phosphatases prevented the activity-induced reduction of the <U+03B3>2 subunit-containing GABAA Rs in organotypic slice cultures. Furthermore  treatment of SE-treated slices with FK506 or OA restored the surface expression of the <U+03B3>2 subunit-containing GABAA Rs and the mIPSC amplitude.SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that the plasticity of <U+03B3>2 subunit-containing GABAA Rs associated with the development of benzodiazepine resistance in young and adult animals is similar. The findings of this study suggest that the mechanisms regulating the activity-dependent trafficking of GABAA Rs during SE can be targeted to develop novel adjunctive therapy for the treatment of benzodiazepine-refractory SE."

ONO-2952 potently bound both rat and human TSPO (Ki=0.330-9.30 nmol/L) with high selectivity over other receptors  transporters  ion channels and enzymes. ONO-2952 inhibited both neurosteroid accumulation and noradrenaline release in the brain of rats exposed to acute stress. The inhibitory effect of ONO-2952 on stress-induced noradrenaline release was attenuated by co-treatment with the TSPO agonist CB34 in a dose-dependent manner. ONO-2952  at 0.3 mg/kg or higher  dose-dependently suppressed restraint stress-induced defecation in rats with brain TSPO occupancy of more than 50%. In addition  ONO-2952  at 1 mg/kg or higher  suppressed conditioned fear stress-induced freezing behavior in rats with an efficacy equivalent to that of diazepam  given orally at 3 mg/kg. Results of the passive avoidance learning test revealed that ONO-2952  unlike diazepam  did not affect learning and memory even at doses 10 times higher than its effective doses in the stress models.

These signaling molecules participate in recruitment of immune cells  including brain macrophages (microglia)  as well as neuroplastic changes  deterioration of damaged tissue  and epileptogenesis. This study describes the temporal and brain region pattern expression of numerous cytokines  including chemokines  after pilocarpine-induced seizures and discusses them in the larger context of their potential involvement in the changes that precede the development of epilepsy.FINDINGS: Adult rats received pilocarpine to induce SE and 90 min after seizure onset were treated with diazepam to mitigate seizures. Rats were subsequently deeply anesthetized and brain regions (hippocampus  piriform cortex  neocortex  and cerebellum) were freshly dissected at 2  6  and 24 h or 5 days after seizures. Using methodology identical to our previous studies  simultaneous assay of multiple cytokines (CCL2  CCL3  CCL5  interleukin IL-1ß  tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a))  and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was performed and compared to control rats. These proteins were selected based on existing evidence implicating them in the epileptogenic progression. A robust increase in CCL2 and CCL3 concentrations in the hippocampus  piriform cortex  and neocortex was observed at all time-points. The concentrations peaked with a ~200-fold increase 24 h after seizures and were two orders of magnitude greater than the significant increases observed for CCL5 and IL-1ß in the same brain structures. TNF-a levels were altered in the piriform cortex and neocortex (24 h) and in the hippocampus (5 days) after SE.CONCLUSIONS: Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus causes a rapid increase of multiple cytokines in limbic and neocortical regions. Understanding the precise spatial and temporal pattern of cytokines and chemokine changes could provide more viable therapeutic targets to reduce  reverse  or prevent the development of epilepsy following a precipitating injury."

Changes in the properties of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAA R) have been suggested to underlie the changes in the characteristics of plasticity. However  it is largely unknown how the changes in the two receptors interact to regulate synaptic plasticity. The present study investigates the changes in the properties of NMDAR and GABAA R from 3 to 5 weeks of age in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the rat visual cortex. The impact of these changes on the characteristics of long-term potentiation (LTP) is also investigated. The amplitude and decay time constant of GABAA R-mediated currents increased during this period. However  the decay time constant of NMDAR-mediated currents decreased as a result of the decrease in the proportion of the GluN2B subunit-mediated component. Induction of NMDAR-dependent LTP at 3 weeks depended on the GluN2B subunit  but LTP at 5 weeks did not. Enhancement of GABAA R-mediated inhibition suppressed the induction of LTP only at 5 weeks. However  partial inhibition of the GluN2B subunit with a low concentration of ifenprodil allowed the GABAA R-mediated suppression of LTP at 3 weeks. These results suggest that changes in the properties of NMDAR- and GABAA R-mediated synaptic transmission interact to determine the characteristics of synaptic plasticity during the critical period in the visual cortex."

Previously  we reported that IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) knockout (KO) mice  which lacked IL-1Ra molecules that antagonize the IL-1 receptor  showed anti-depression-like behavior via adrenergic modulation at the age of 8 weeks. Here  we report that IL-1Ra KO mice display an anxiety-like phenotype that is induced spontaneously by aging in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test. This anxiety-like phenotype was improved by the administration of diazepam. The expression of the anxiety-related molecule glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was significantly reduced in 20-week-old but not in 11-week-old IL-1Ra KO mice compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. The expression of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) was not altered between IL-1Ra KO mice and WT littermates at either 11 or 20 weeks old. Analysis of monoamine concentration in the hippocampus revealed that tryptophan  the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA)  and the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) were significantly increased in 20-week-old IL-1Ra KO mice compared to littermate WT mice.

Furthermore  retinoid-dependent effects of fluoxetine on neuronal survival following glutamate exposure were investigated in rat primary neurons cells using specific retinoid receptor antagonists. Experiments revealed dose-dependent inhibition of synaptosomal RA degradation by fluoxetine along with dose-dependent increases in RA levels in cell cultures. Furthermore  fluoxetine's neuroprotective effects against glutamate excitotoxicity in rat primary neurons were demonstrated to partially depend on RA signaling. Taken together  these findings demonstrate for the first time that the potent  pleiotropic antidepressant fluoxetine directly interacts with RA homeostasis in brain tissue  thereby exerting its neuroprotective effects."
"44","25963418","Positive modulation of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors by an antagonist of the high affinity benzodiazepine binding site.","GABAA receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and are the target for many clinically important drugs such as the benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines act at the high-affinity binding site at the a+/<U+03B3>- subunit interface. Previously  an additional low affinity binding site for diazepam located in the transmembrane (TM) domain has been described. The compound SJM-3 was recently identified in a prospective screening of ligands for the benzodiazepine binding site and investigated for its site of action. We determined the binding properties of SJM-3 at GABAA receptors recombinantly expressed in HEK-cells using radioactive ligand binding assays. Impact on function was assessed in Xenopus laevis oocytes with electrophysiological experiments using the two-electrode voltage clamp method. SJM-3 was shown to act as an antagonist at the a+/<U+03B3>- site. At the same time it strongly potentiated GABA currents via the binding site for diazepam in the transmembrane domain. Mutation of a residue in M2 of the a subunit strongly reduced receptor modulation by SJM-3 and a homologous mutation in the ß subunit abolished potentiation. SJM-3 acts as a more efficient modulator than diazepam at the site in the trans-membrane domain. In contrast to low concentrations of benzodiazepines  SJM-3 modulates both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. A detailed exploration of the membrane site may provide the basis for the design and identification of subtype-selective modulatory drugs."

In around 30% of patients with epilepsy  their seizures are not satisfactorily controlled and drug-resistant epilepsy constitutes a real therapeutic challenge. Consequently  there are efforts aimed at the inhibition of epileptogenesis  a process of converting a normal into an epileptic brain. Data on this problem have been mainly obtained in post-status epilepticus rodent models in which spontaneous seizure activity and behavioral disturbances develop over time. Among antiepileptic drugs  diazepam at high dose of 20mg/kg given during status epilepticus  significantly inhibited the development of spontaneous seizures and also  a strong neuroprotective effect was evident. Also gabapentin and valproate (over a period of 40 days) proved effective in the inhibition of spontaneous seizure activity and reduction of behavioral deficit. However  there are also data that valproate (over 28 days) significantly improved the behavioral performance without affecting the occurrence of spontaneous seizures. A number of antiepileptic drugs  carbamazepine  lamotrigine  levetiracetam  phenobarbital  and topiramate were completely ineffective. Among non-antiepileptic drugs  some promise show rapamycin  losartan and combinations of anti-inflammatory drugs  targeting different inflammatory pathways. Inhibition of epileptogenesis may become a valuable therapeutic approach provided that there are reliable markers of this process. Actually  such markers begin to emerge."

GLP-1 receptors are also found in the brain where their signalling affects neuronal activity. We have previously shown that the GLP-1 receptor agonists  GLP-1 and exendin-4 enhanced GABA-activated synaptic and tonic currents in rat hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons. The hippocampus is the centre for memory and learning and is important for cognition. Here we examined if exendin-4 similarly enhanced the GABA-activated currents in the presence of the benzodiazepine diazepam. In whole-cell recordings in rat brain slices  diazepam (1 µM)  an allosteric positive modulator of GABAA receptors  alone enhanced the spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) amplitude and frequency by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6  respectively  and doubled the tonic GABAA current normally recorded in the CA3 pyramidal cells. Importantly  in the presence of exendin-4 (10 nM) plus diazepam (1 µM)  only the tonic but not the sIPSC currents transiently increased as compared to currents recorded in the presence of diazepam alone. The results suggest that exendin-4 potentiates a subpopulation of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors in the CA3 pyramidal neurons."

The hippocampus is profoundly damaged after soman exposure leading to long-term memory deficits. We have previously shown that treatment with three sequential doses of alpha-linolenic acid  an essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid  increases brain plasticity in naïve animals. However  the effects of this dosing schedule administered after a brain insult and the underlying molecular mechanisms in the hippocampus are unknown. We now show that injection of three sequential doses of alpha-linolenic acid after soman exposure increases the endogenous expression of mature BDNF  activates Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)  increases neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus  increases retention latency in the passive avoidance task and increases animal survival. In sharp contrast  while soman exposure also increases mature BDNF  this increase did not activate downstream signaling pathways or neurogenesis. Administration of the inhibitor of mTORC1  rapamycin  blocked the alpha-linolenic acid-induced neurogenesis and the enhanced retention latency but did not affect animal survival. Our results suggest that alpha-linolenic acid induces a long-lasting neurorestorative effect that involves activation of mTORC1 possibly via a BDNF-TrkB-mediated mechanism."
"48","25882826","Combined treatment with diazepam and allopregnanolone reverses tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS)-induced calcium dysregulation in cultured neurons and protects TETS-intoxicated mice against lethal seizures.","Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) is a potent convulsant GABAA receptor blocker. Mice receiving a lethal dose of TETS (0.15 mg/kg i.p.) are rescued from death by a high dose of diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.) administered shortly after the second clonic seizure (~20 min post-TETS). However  this high dose of diazepam significantly impairs blood pressure and mobility  and does not prevent TETS-induced neuroinflammation in the brain. We previously demonstrated that TETS alters synchronous Ca(2+) oscillations in primary mouse hippocampal neuronal cell cultures and that pretreatment with the combination of diazepam and allopregnanolone at concentrations having negligible effects individually prevents TETS effects on intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics. Here  we show that treatment with diazepam and allopregnanolone (0.1 µM) 20 min after TETS challenge normalizes synchronous Ca(2+) oscillations when added in combination but not when added singly. Similarly  doses (0.03-0.1 mg/kg i.p.) of diazepam and allopregnanolone that provide minimal protection when administered singly to TETS intoxicated mice increase survival from 10% to 90% when given in combination either 10 min prior to TETS or following the second clonic seizure. This therapeutic combination has negligible effects on blood pressure or mobility. Combined treatment with diazepam and allopregnanolone also decreases TETS-induced microglial activation. Diazepam and allopregnanolone have distinct actions as positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors that in combination enhance survival and mitigate neuropathology following TETS intoxication without the adverse side effects associated with high dose benzodiazepines. Combination therapy with a benzodiazepine and neurosteroid represents a novel neurotherapeutic strategy with potentially broad application."

Here we report that the anxiolytic drugs lorazepam and diazepam increased the time larval fish spent in the dark compartment in the light/dark test. Lorazepam did not affect the visual induced optokinetic response of larval fish. Gene expression levels of c-fos and crh were significantly increased in the hypothalamus of fish larvae underwent light/dark choice behavior  whilst lorazepam treatment alleviated the increased c-fos and crh expressions. Furthermore  we found estrogen receptor ß gene expression level was increased in fish larvae underwent light/dark choice. We next examined effects of estrogen receptor modulators (estradiol  BPA  PHTPP  and WAY-200070) in the light/dark test. We identified WAY-200070  a highly selective ERß agonist significantly altered the light/dark choice behavior of zebrafish larvae. Further investigation showed WAY-200070 treatment caused a reduction of crh expression level in the hypothalamus  suggesting activation of ERß signaling attenuate the stress response. Interestingly  WAY-200070 treatment caused marked increase of c-fos expression in the habenula of fish larvae underwent behavior test. These results suggest WAY-200070 activation of ERß mediated signaling may regulate anxiety related behavior in zebrafish through modulation of neuronal activity in habenula."

However  little is known about the involvement of this system in the panicolytic property also exerted by these compounds. In the present study we evaluated the participation of the BDNF-TRKB system of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG)  a core structure involved in the pathophysiology of panic disorder  in AD-induced panicolytic-like effects in rats. The results showed that short- (3 days) or long-term (21 days) systemic treatment with the tricyclic ADs imipramine  clomipramine or desipramine increased BDNF levels in the DPAG. Only longterm treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine was able to increase BDNF levels in this structure. After 21-day treatment  fluoxetine and the three tricyclic ADs used also increased BDNF concentration in the hippocampus  a key area implicated in their mood-related actions. Neither in the DPAG nor hippocampus did long-term treatment with the standard anxiolytics diazepam  clonazepam or buspirone affect BDNF levels. Imipramine  both after short and long-term administration  and fluoxetine under the latter regimen  raised the levels of phosphorylated TRKB in the DPAG. Short-term treatment with imipramine or BDNF microinjection inhibited escape expression in rats exposed to the elevated T maze  considered as a panicolytic-like effect. This anti-escape effect was attenuated by the intra-DPAG administration of the TRK receptor antagonist k252a. Altogether  our data suggests that facilitation of the BDNF-TRKB system in the DPAG is implicated in the panicolytic effect of ADs."
"52","25783504","Combined diazepam and MK-801 therapy provides synergistic protection from tetramethylenedisulfotetramine-induced tonic-clonic seizures and lethality in mice.","The synthetic rodenticide  tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TMDT)  is a persistent and highly lethal GABA-gated Cl(-) channel blocker. TMDT is clandestinely produced  remains popular in mainland China  and causes numerous unintentional and deliberate poisonings worldwide. TMDT is odorless  tasteless  and easy to manufacture  features that make it a potential weapon of terrorism. There is no effective treatment. We previously characterized the effects of TMDT in C57BL/6 mice and surveyed efficacies of GABAergic and glutamatergic anticonvulsant treatments. At 0.4 mg/kg i.p.  TMDT produced neurotoxic symptomatology consisting of twitches  clonic and tonic-clonic seizures  often progressing to status epilepticus and death. If administered immediately after the occurrence of the first clonic seizure  the benzodiazepine diazepam (DZP) effectively prevented all subsequent seizure symptoms  whereas the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) primarily prevented tonic-clonic seizures. The latter agent  however  appeared to be more effective at preventing delayed death. The present study further explored these phenomena  and characterized the therapeutic actions of DZP and MK-801 as combinations. Joint treatment with both DZP and MK-801 displayed synergistic protection against tonic-clonic seizures and 24 h lethality as determined by isobolographic analysis. Clonic seizures  however  remained poorly controlled. A modification of the treatment regimen  where DZP was followed 10 min later by MK-801  yielded a reduction in both types of seizures and improved overall outcome. Simultaneous monitoring of subjects via EEG and videography confirmed effectiveness of this sequential regimen. We conclude that TMDT blockage at GABAA receptors involves early activation of NMDA receptors  which contribute to persistent ictogenic activity. Our data predict that a sequential combination treatment with DZP followed by MK-801 will be superior to either individual therapy with  or simultaneous administration of  these two agents in treating TMDT poisoning."

The therapy involves the administration of benzodiazepine drugs. Purinergic signaling participates in the induction of several behavioral patterns and their actions are inactivated by ectonucleotidases and adenosine deaminase (ADA). Since there is evidence about the involvement of purinergic system in the actions mediated by benzodiazepines  we evaluated the effects in vitro and in vivo of administration of diazepam and midazolam on nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases  ecto-5'-nucleotidase  and ADA activities in zebrafish brain  followed by the analysis of gene expression pattern of these enzymes and adenosine receptors (A1  A2a1  A2a2  A2b). The in vitro studies demonstrated that diazepam decreased ATP (66 % for 500 µM) and ADP hydrolysis (40-54 % for 10-500 µM  respectively). Midazolam decreased ATP (16-71 % for 10-500 µM  respectively) and ADP (48-73.5 % for 250-500 µM  respectively) hydrolysis as well as the ecto-ADA activity (26-27.5 % for 10-500 µM  respectively). AMP hydrolysis was decreased in animals treated with of 0.5 and 1 mg/L midazolam (32 and 36 %  respectively). Diazepam and midazolam decreased the ecto-ADA activity at 1.25 mg/L and 1 mg/L (31 and 33 %  respectively)  but only 0.1 mg/L midazolam induced an increase (40 %) in cytosolic ADA. The gene expression analysis demonstrated changes on ecto-5'-nucleotidase  A1  A2a1  A2a2  and A2b mRNA transcript levels after acute treatment with benzodiazepines. These findings demonstrated that benzodiazepine exposure induces a modulation of extracellular nucleotide and nucleoside metabolism  suggesting the purinergic signaling may be  at least in part  related to benzodiazepine effects."

In the present study  the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects of the Acacia tortilis  were evaluated by using different paradigms. For extraction  the leaves of acacia were blended with distilled water at 40°C and filtered. Two different doses of the extracts (400 and 800mg/kg) were administered in the mice once orally (p.o.) and after 30 min occurrence of seizures (strychnine at the dose of 1mg/kg  i.m.) were monitored. In the present work  acute toxicity and neurotoxicity of the extracts were also assessed by inducing hypoxic stress. The Acacia tortilis leaves AAq (400 and 800 mg/kg) produced a dose dependent increase in time of onset of seizures (197.8±32.4 and 338.2±40.6 respectively) when compared with its respective control (184.0±13.8sec). The anticonvulsant effect after administration of AAq (800mg/kg: 338.2±40.6 sec) was more pronounced than diazepam (290.6±1.38 sec). The high dose (800mg/kg) of AAq administered orally prolonged the onset of convulsion and latencies for death following hypoxic stress. The present study suggested that Acacia have anticonvulsant property and may probably be affecting the inhibitory mechanism of glycine. It is also concluded that chemical constituent of acacia might act on BZD or 5-HT(1A) receptor and decrease the oxidative brain membrane damage process induced by psychological/hypoxic stress.

As GABAergic system is also target for ethanol  we analysed its anxiolytic-like and sedative properties in Wfs1-deficient mice using elevated plus-maze test and tests measuring locomotor activity and coordination  respectively. Additionally loss of righting reflex test was conducted to study sedative/hypnotic properties of ethanol  ketamine and pentobarbital. To evaluate pharmacokinetics of ethanol in mice enzymatic colour test was used. Finally  gene expression of alpha subunits of GABAA receptors following ethanol treatment was studied by real-time-PCR. Compared to wild-types  Wfs1-deficient mice were more sensitive to ethanol-induced anxiolytic-like effect  but less responsive to impairment of motor coordination. Ethanol and pentobarbital  but not ketamine  caused longer duration of hypnosis in Wfs1-deficient mice. The expression of Gabra2 subunit at 30 minutes after ethanol injection was significantly increased in the frontal cortex of Wfs1-deficient mice as compared to respective vehicle-treated mice. For the temporal lobe  similar change in Gabra2 mRNA occurred at 60 minutes after ethanol treatment in Wfs1-deficient mice. No changes were detected in Gabra1 and Gabra3 mRNA following ethanol treatment. Taken together  increased anxiolytic-like effect of ethanol in Wfs1-deficient mice is probably related to altered Gabra2 gene expression. Increased anti-anxiety effect of GABAA receptor agonists in the present work and earlier studies (Luuk et al.  2009) further suggests importance of Wfs1 gene in the regulation of emotional behaviour."

Benign convulsions with mild gastroenteritis were defined as a condition of (a) seizures associated with gastroenteritis without electrolyte imbalance  hypoglycemia  or dehydration in patients (b) between 6 months and 3 years of age with (c) no preexisting neurological disorders  (d) no impaired consciousness  and (e) a body temperature less than 38.0 °C before and after the seizures. The efficacy of fosphenytoin was categorized as effective when cessation of seizures was achieved.RESULTS: Data from 16 child patients were obtained (median age  20 months). Seizures were completely controlled after the initial dose of fosphenytoin in 14 of 16 patients. The median loading dose of fosphenytoin was 22.5 mg/kg. In 10 patients  fosphenytoin was administered after other antiepileptic drugs such as diazepam and midazolam were used.

Although AP521 did not bind to the benzodiazepine receptor  it did bind to 5-HT1A  5-HT1B  5-HT1D  5-HT5A and 5-HT7 receptors  and showed agonist activity for the human 5-HT1A receptor expressed in HEK293 cells. Tandospirone  which can stimulate the presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the raphe  tended to decrease extracellular 5-HT concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in rats. In contrast  AP521 increased extracellular 5-HT concentration. In addition  AP521 enhanced the anti-freezing effect of citalopram  a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  in the fear conditioning model in rats and enhanced the citalopram-caused increase of the extracellular 5-HT concentration in the mPFC.

These results indicate that diazepam  clobazam  and RL 214 interact exclusively with a1 ß2/3 <U+03B3>2 receptors  while N-desmethyl-diazepam seems to interact with not only a1- but also a6-containing receptors."
"64","25600373","Closing the gap between the molecular and systemic actions of anesthetic agents.","Genetic approaches have been successfully used to relate the diverse molecular actions of anesthetic agents to their amnestic  sedative  hypnotic  and immobilizing properties. The hypnotic effect of etomidate  quantified as the duration of the loss of righting reflex in mice  is equally mediated by GABAA receptors containing ß2- and ß3-protein subunits. However  only ß3-containing receptors are involved in producing electroencephalogram (EEG)-patterns typical of general anesthesia. The sedative action of diazepam is produced by a1-subunit-containing receptors  but these receptors do not contribute to the drug's characteristic EEG-&quot;fingerprint.&quot; Thus  GABAA receptors with a1- and ß2-subunits take a central role in causing benzodiazepine-induced sedation and etomidate-induced hypnosis  but the corresponding EEG-signature is difficult to resolve. Contrastingly  actions of etomidate and benzodiazepines mediated via a2- and ß3-subunits modify rhythmic brain activity in vitro and in vivo at least in part by enhancing neuronal synchrony. The immobilizing action of GABAergic anesthetics predominantly involves ß3-subunit-containing GABAA receptors in the spinal cord. Interestingly  this action is self-limiting as GABA-release is attenuated via the same receptors. Anesthetic-induced amnesia is in part mediated by GABAA receptors harboring a5-subunits that are highly enriched in the hippocampus and  in addition  by a1-containing receptors in the forebrain. Because there is accumulating evidence that in patients the expression pattern of GABAA receptor subtypes varies with age  is altered by the long-term use of drugs  and is affected by pathological conditions like inflammation and sepsis  further research is recommended to adapt the use of anesthetic agents to the specific requirements of individual patients."

The primary neural action of BZs and related compounds is augmentation of inhibitory transmission  which occurs through allosteric modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced current at the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAAR). The discovery of the BZ-binding site on GABAARs encouraged many to speculate that the brain produces its own endogenous ligands to this site (Costa &amp; Guidotti  1985). The romanticized quest for endozepines  endogenous ligands to the BZ-binding site  has uncovered a variety of ligands that might fulfill this role  including oleamides (Cravatt et al.  1995)  nonpeptidic endozepines (Rothstein et al.  1992)  and the protein diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) (Costa &amp; Guidotti  1985). Of these ligands  DBI  and affiliated peptide fragments  is the most extensively studied endozepine. The quest for the &quot;brain's Valium&quot; over the decades has been elusive as mainly negative allosteric modulatory effects have been observed (Alfonso  Le Magueresse  Zuccotti  Khodosevich  &amp; Monyer  2012; Costa &amp; Guidotti  1985)  but recent evidence is accumulating that DBI displays regionally discrete endogenous positive modulation of GABA transmission through activation of the BZ receptor (Christian et al.  2013). Herein  we review the literature on this topic  focusing on identification of the endogenous molecule and its region-specific expression and function."

Several studies have suggested that ACBP acts as an acyl-CoA pool former and regulates long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) metabolism in peripheral tissues. In the brain  ACBP is known as Diazepam-Binding Inhibitor  a secreted peptide acting as an allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. However  its role in central LCFA metabolism remains unknown. In the present study  we investigated ACBP cellular expression  ACBP regulation of LCFA intracellular metabolism  FA profile  and FA metabolism-related gene expression using ACBP-deficient and control mice. ACBP was mainly found in astrocytes with high expression levels in the mediobasal hypothalamus. We demonstrate that ACBP deficiency alters the central LCFA-CoA profile and impairs unsaturated (oleate  linolenate) but not saturated (palmitate  stearate) LCFA metabolic fluxes in hypothalamic slices and astrocyte cultures. In addition  lack of ACBP differently affects the expression of genes involved in FA metabolism in cortical versus hypothalamic astrocytes. Finally  ACBP deficiency increases FA content and impairs their release in response to palmitate in hypothalamic astrocytes. Collectively  these findings reveal for the first time that central ACBP acts as a regulator of LCFA intracellular metabolism in astrocytes. Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) or diazepam-binding inhibitor is a secreted peptide acting centrally as a GABAA allosteric modulator. Using brain slices  cortical  and hypothalamic astrocyte cultures from ACBP KO mice  we demonstrate that ACBP mainly localizes in astrocytes and regulates unsaturated but not saturated long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) metabolism. In addition  ACBP deficiency alters FA metabolism-related genes and results in intracellular FA accumulation while affecting their release. Our results support a novel role for ACBP in brain lipid metabolism. FA  fatty acids; KO  knockout; PL  phospholipids; TAG  triacylglycerol."

Neuronal loss and aberrant neuroplastic changes in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus have been identified in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling model. Antiseizure activity of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has been reported in several studies. In the current study  the protective effect of fluvoxamine against PTZ-kindling was investigated in terms of seizure scores  neuronal loss  and regulation of hippocampal neuroplasticity. Further  the role of 5-HT3 receptors was determined. Kindling was induced by repeated injections of PTZ (35<U+2009>mg/kg) thrice weekly  for a total of 13 injections. One hundred male albino mice were allocated into 10 groups: (1) saline  (2) PTZ  (3) diazepam (1<U+2009>mg/kg)+PTZ  (4-6) fluvoxamine (5  10 or 20<U+2009>mg/kg)+PTZ  (7) ondansetron+fluvoxamine (20<U+2009>mg/kg)+PTZ  (8) ondansetron+PTZ group  (9) ondansetron (2<U+2009>mg/kg  i.p.)+saline  and (10) fluvoxamine (20<U+2009>mg/kg)+saline. PTZ-kindled mice showed high seizure activity  hippocampal neuronal loss  and expression of growth-associated phosphoprotein (GAP-43) compared with saline-treated mice. Repeated administration of fluvoxamine (20<U+2009>mg/kg) in PTZ-kindled mice suppressed seizure scores  protected against hippocampal neuronal loss  and downregulated GAP-43 expression  without producing any signs of the 5-HT syndrome in healthy rats. Importantly  pretreatment with a selective 5-HT3 receptor blocker (ondansetron) attenuated the aforementioned effects of fluvoxamine. In conclusion  the ameliorating effect of fluvoxamine on hippocampal neurons and neuroplasticity in PTZ-kindled mice was  at least in part  dependent on enhancement of hippocampal serotoninergic transmission at 5-HT3 receptors."

During microdialysis experiments  rats were treated with saline (SS-SE) or sodium cromoglycate (CG-SE) and 30 min later received the administration of pilocarpine to induce status epilepticus. Twenty-four hours after the status epilepticus  the brains were used to determine the neuronal damage and the number of mast cells in hippocampus. During the status epilepticus  SS-SE group showed an enhanced release of histamine (138.5%  p = 0.005)  GABA (331 ± 91%  p = 0.001) and glutamate (467%  p = 0.001)  even after diazepam administration. One day after the status epilepticus  SS-SE group demonstrated increased number of mast cells in Stratum pyramidale of CA1 (88%  p &lt; 0.001) and neuronal damage in dentate gyrus  CA1 and CA3. In contrast to SS-SE group  rats from the CG-SE group showed increased latency to the establishment of the status epilepticus (p = 0.048)  absence of wet-dog shakes  reduced histamine (but not GABA and glutamate) release  lower number of mast cells (p = 0.008) and reduced neuronal damage in hippocampus. Our data revealed that histamine  possibly from mast cells  is released in hippocampus during the status epilepticus.

In neonatal chicks  central Ghr induces anxiogenic-like behavior but strongly inhibits food intake. The intermediate medial mesopallium (IMM) of the chick forebrain has been identified to be a site of the memory formation  and the modulation of the GABAA receptors that are present here modifies the expression of behavior. Thus  the GABAergic system may constitute a central pathway for Ghr action in regulating the processes of food intake and stress-related behaviors. Therefore  we investigated if the effect of systemic administration of bicuculline (GABAA receptor antagonist) and diazepam (benzodiazepine receptor agonist) on the anxiety in an Open Field test and inhibition in food intake induced by Grh (30pmol) when injected into IMM  were mediated by GABAergic transmission. In Open Field test  bicuculline was able to block the anxiogenic-like behavior induced by Ghr  whereas diazepam did not produce it. However  the co-administration of bicuculline or diazepam plus Ghr did not show any change in food intake at 30  60 and 120min after injection compared to Ghr alone. Our results indicate for the first time that Ghr  injected into the forebrain IMM area  induces an anxiogenic-like behavior  which was blocked by bicuculline but not diazepam  thus suggesting that Ghr plays an important role in the response pattern to acute stressor  involving the possible participation of the GABAergic system. Nevertheless  as neither drug affected the hypophagia induced by intra-IMM Ghr  this suggests that it may be mediated by different mechanisms."

We previously reported that D3R null mice (D3R(-/-)) exhibit low baseline anxiety levels and that acutely administrated diazepam is more effective in D3R(-/-) than in wild type (WT) when tested in the elevated plus maze test (EPM). Here we tested the hypothesis that genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of D3R affect GABAA subunit expression  which in turn modulates anxiety-like behaviour as well as responsiveness and tolerance to diazepam. D3R(-/-) mice exhibited tolerance to diazepam (0.5mg/kg  i.p.)  assessed by EPM  as fast as after 3 day-treatment  performing similarly to untreated D3R(-/-) mice; conversely  WT exhibited tolerance to diazepam after a 14-21 day-treatment. Analysis of GABAA a6 subunit mRNA expression by qPCR in striatum showed that it was about 15-fold higher in D3R(-/-) than in WT. Diazepam treatment did not modify a6 expression in D3R(-/-)  but progressively increased a6 expression in WT  to the level of untreated D3R(-/-) after 14-21 day-treatment. BDNF mRNA expression in striatum was remarkably (&gt;10-fold) increased after 3 days of diazepam-treatment in both WT and D3R(-/-); such expression level  however  slowly declined below control levels  by 14-21 days. Following a 7 day-treatment with the selective D3R antagonist SB277011A  WT exhibited a fast tolerance to diazepam accompanied by a robust increase in a6 subunit expression. In conclusion  genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of D3R accelerate the development of tolerance to repeated administrations of diazepam and increase a6 subunit expression  a GABAA subunit that has been linked to diazepam insensitivity. Modulation of GABAA receptor by DA transmission may be involved in the mechanisms of anxiety and  if occurring in humans  may have therapeutic relevance following repeated use of drugs targeting D3R."

The concentrations of ethanol in such formulations are generally considered reasonably safe. It is long known that ethanol can potentiate central effects of sedatives and tranquillizers  particularly the benzodiazepines  most likely as a result of a synergistic interaction at the GABAA receptor. However  whether this occurs at the low systemic doses of ethanol resulting from its use as solvent in parenteral formulations of benzodiazepines is not known. In the present study we evaluated whether a commercial ethanol-containing aqueous solution of diazepam exerts more potent anti-seizure effects than an aqueous solution of diazepam hydrochloride or an aqueous emulsion of this drug in the intrahippocampal kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy in mice. Spontaneous epileptic seizures in this model are known to be resistant to major antiepileptic drugs. Administration of the ethanol-containing formulation of diazepam caused an almost complete suppression of seizures. This was not seen when the same dose (5 mg/kg) of diazepam was administered as aqueous solution or emulsion  although all three diazepam formulations resulted in similar drug and metabolite concentrations in plasma. Our data demonstrate that ethanol-containing solutions of diazepam are superior to block difficult-to-treat seizures to other formulations of diazepam. To our knowledge  this has not been demonstrated before and  if this finding can be translated to humans  may have important consequences for emergency treatment of acute seizures  series of seizures  and initial treatment of status epilepticus in patients."

Pilocarpine-induced SE was used to determine if COX-2 inhibition with NS-398  when administered alone or with diazepam  decreases the duration and/or intensity of SE and/or reduces neuronal injury in the rat hippocampus.METHODS: Electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes were implanted in male Sprague-Dawley rats. SE was induced with lithium-pilocarpine  and continuous EEG and video monitoring were performed for 24 h. Rats were divided into four groups (n=8-14 rats/group) and received NS-398  diazepam  NS-398 and diazepam  or vehicle 30 min after the first motor seizure. Six hours later  NS-398 injection was repeated in the NS-398 and in the NS-398+diazepam groups. The duration of SE (continuous spiking) and the EEG power in the <U+03B3>-band were analyzed. FluoroJade B staining in the dorsal hippocampus at 24h after SE was analyzed semi-quantitatively in the CA1  CA3 and hilus.RESULTS: The duration and intensity of electrographic SE was not significantly different across the four groups. In rats treated with NS-398 alone  compared to vehicle-treated rats  neuronal damage was significantly lower compared to vehicle-treated rats in the CA3 (27%) and hilus (27%)  but neuroprotection was not detected in the CA1. When NS-398 was administered with diazepam  decreased neuronal damage was further obtained in all areas investigated (CA1: 61%  CA3: 63%  hilus: 60%).CONCLUSIONS: NS-398  when administered 30 min after the onset of SE with a repeat dose at 6h  decreased neuronal damage in the hippocampus. Administration of diazepam with NS-398 potentiates the neuroprotective effect of the COX-2 inhibitor. These neuroprotective effects occurred with no detectable effect on electrographic SE."

We  therefore  investigated the effects of post-exposure administration of diazepam  a GABAAR positive allosteric modulator  on seizure activity  death and neuroinflammation in adult male Swiss mice injected with a lethal dose of TETS (0.15mg/kg  ip). Administration of a high dose of diazepam (5mg/kg  ip) immediately following the second clonic seizure (approximately 20min post-TETS injection) effectively prevented progression to tonic seizures and death. However  this treatment did not prevent persistent reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation  as determined by GFAP and Iba-1 immunoreactivity and microglial cell morphology. Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) has been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects and to increase survival in mice intoxicated with other GABAAR antagonists. The sEH inhibitor TUPS (1mg/kg  ip) administered immediately after the second clonic seizure did not protect TETS-intoxicated animals from tonic seizures or death. Combined administration of diazepam (5mg/kg  ip) and TUPS (1mg/kg  ip  starting 1h after diazepam and repeated every 24h) prevented TETS-induced lethality and influenced signs of neuroinflammation in some brain regions. Significantly decreased microglial activation and enhanced reactive astrogliosis were observed in the hippocampus  with no changes in the cortex. Combining an agent that targets specific anti-inflammatory mechanisms with a traditional antiseizure drug may enhance treatment outcome in TETS intoxication."

As cerebrovascular defects are associated with AD  we tested whether APOE genotype has an impact on the integrity and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in human APOE-targeted replacement mice. Using the quantitative in situ brain perfusion technique  we first found lower (13.0% and 17.0%) brain transport coefficient (Clup) of [(3)H]-diazepam in APOE4 mice at 4 and 12 months  compared with APOE2 and APOE3 mice  reflecting a decrease in cerebral vascularization. Accordingly  results from immunohistofluorescence experiments revealed a structurally reduced cerebral vascularization (26% and 38%) and thinner basement membranes (30% and 35%) in 12-month-old APOE4 mice compared with APOE2 and APOE3 mice  suggesting vascular atrophy. In addition  APOE4 mice displayed a 29% reduction in [(3)H]-d-glucose transport through the BBB compared with APOE2 mice without significant changes in the expression of its transporter GLUT1 in brain capillaries. However  an increase of 41.3% of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was found in brain capillaries of 12-month-old APOE4 mice.

In addition  firing pattern of neurons with spike output can powerfully affect functional output of the brain nucleus  and GABAergic neurons are crucial in the modulation of neuronal excitability. In this study  we first investigated whether pain-related plasticity (e.g. alteration of neuronal firing patterns) and sensitization of CeA neurons contribute to nerve injury-evoked anxiety in neuropathic rats. Furthermore  we explored whether GABAergic disinhibition is responsible for regulating firing patterns and intrinsic excitabilities of CeA neurons as well as for pain-related anxiety in neuropathic rats.RESULTS: We discovered that spinal nerve ligation (SNL) produced neuropathic pain-related anxiety-like behaviors in rats  which could be specifically inhibited by intra-CeA administration of anti-anxiety drug diazepam. Moreover  we found potentiated plasticity and sensitization of CeA neurons in SNL-induced anxiety rats  of which including: 1) increased burst firing pattern and early-adapting firing pattern; 2) increased spike frequency and intrinsic excitability; 3) increased amplitude of both after-depolarized-potential (ADP) and sub-threshold membrane potential oscillation. In addition  we observed a remarkable reduction of GABAergic inhibition in CeA neurons in SNL-induced anxiety rats  which was proved to be important for altered firing patterns and hyperexcitability of CeA neurons  thereby greatly contributing to the development of neuropathic pain-related anxiety. Accordantly  activation of GABAergic inhibition by intra-CeA administration of muscimol  a selective GABAA receptors agonist  could inhibit SNL-induced anxiety-like behaviors in neuropathic rats. By contrast  suppression of GABAergic inhibition by intra-CeA administration of bicuculline  a selective GABAA receptors antagonist  produced anxiety-like behavior in normal rats.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that reduction of GABAergic inhibition may be responsible for potentiated plasticity and sensitization of CeA neurons  which likely underlie the enhanced output of amygdala and neuropathic pain-related anxiety in SNL rats."

Similarly  Parkinson's disease (PD) might involve the selective loss of pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) cholinergic neurons. Therefore  lesions of these functionally distinct cholinergic centers in rats might serve as models of AD and PD cholinergic neuropathologies. Our previous articles described dissimilar sleep/wake-state disorders in rat models of AD and PD cholinergic neuropathologies. This study further examines astroglial and microglial responses as underlying pathologies in these distinct sleep disorders. Unilateral lesions of the NB or the PPT were induced with rats under ketamine/diazepam anesthesia (50 mg/kg i.p.) by using stereotaxically guided microinfusion of the excitotoxin ibotenic acid (IBO). Twenty-one days after the lesion  loss of cholinergic neurons was quantified by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase histochemistry  and the astroglial and microglial responses were quantified by glia fibrillary acidic protein/OX42 immunohistochemistry. This study demonstrates  for the first time  the anatomofunctionally related astroglial response following unilateral excitotoxic PPT cholinergic neuronal lesion. Whereas IBO NB and PPT lesions similarly enhanced local astroglial and microglial responses  astrogliosis in the PPT was followed by a remote astrogliosis within the ipslilateral NB. Conversely  there was no microglial response within the NB after PPT lesions. Our results reveal the rostrorostral PPT-NB astrogliosis after denervation of cholinergic neurons in the PPT. This hierarchically and anatomofunctionally guided PPT-NB astrogliosis emerged following cholinergic neuronal loss greater than 17% throughout the overall rostrocaudal PPT dimension."
"84","25245814","Characterization of GABAB-receptor mediated neurotransmission in the human cortex by paired-pulse TMS-EEG.","GABAB-receptor (GABABR) mediated inhibition is important in regulating neuronal excitability. The paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol of long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) likely reflects this GABABergic inhibition. However  this view is based on indirect evidence from electromyographic (EMG) studies. Here we combined paired-pulse TMS with simultaneous electroencephalography (paired-pulse TMS-EEG) and pharmacology to directly investigate mechanisms of LICI at the cortical level. We tested the effects of a conditioning stimulus (CS100) applied 100ms prior to a test stimulus (TS) over primary motor cortex on TS-evoked EEG-potentials (TEPs). Healthy subjects were given a single oral dose of baclofen  a GABABR agonist  or diazepam  a positive modulator at GABAARs  in a placebo-controlled  pseudo-randomized double-blinded crossover study. LICI was quantified as the difference between paired-pulse TEPs (corrected for long-lasting EEG responses by the conditioning pulse) minus single-pulse TEPs. LICI at baseline (i.e. pre-drug intake) was characterized by decreased P25  N45  N100 and P180 and increased P70 TEP components. Baclofen resulted in a trend towards the enhancement of LICI of the N45 and N100  and significantly enhanced LICI of the P180. In contrast  diazepam consistently suppressed LICI of late potentials (i.e. N100  P180)  without having an effect on LICI of earlier (i.e. P25  N45 and P70) potentials. These findings demonstrate for the first time directly at the system level of the human cortex that GABABR-mediated cortical inhibition contributes to LICI  while GABAAR-mediated inhibition occludes LICI. Paired-pulse TMS-EEG allows investigating cortical GABABR-mediated inhibition more directly and specifically than hitherto possible  and may thus inform on network abnormalities caused by disordered inhibition  e.g. in patients with schizophrenia or epilepsy."

We have recently developed an in vitro BBB model using primary porcine brain endothelial cells. The model shows expression of tight junction proteins and high transendothelial electrical resistance  evidence for a restrictive paracellular pathway. Validation studies using small drug-like compounds demonstrated functional uptake and efflux transporters  showing the suitability of the model to assay drug permeability. However  one limitation of in vitro model permeability measurement is the presence of the aqueous boundary layer (ABL) resulting from inefficient stirring during the permeability assay. The ABL can be a rate-limiting step in permeation  particularly for lipophilic compounds  causing underestimation of the permeability. If the ABL effect is ignored  the permeability measured in vitro will not reflect the permeability in vivo. To address the issue  we explored the combination of in vitro permeability measurement using our porcine model with the pKa(FLUX) method in pCEL-X software to correct for the ABL effect and allow a detailed analysis of in vitro (transendothelial) permeability data  Papp. Published Papp using porcine models generated by our group and other groups are also analyzed. From the Papp  intrinsic transcellular permeability (P0) is derived by simultaneous refinement using a weighted nonlinear regression  taking into account permeability through the ABL  paracellular permeability and filter restrictions on permeation. The in vitro P0 derived for 22 compounds (35 measurements) showed good correlation with P0 derived from in situ brain perfusion data (r(2)=0.61). The analysis also gave evidence for carrier-mediated uptake of naloxone  propranolol and vinblastine. The combination of the in vitro porcine model and the software analysis provides a useful tool to better predict BBB permeability in vivo and gain better mechanistic information about BBB permeation."
"86","25220148","Brief dark exposure restored ocular dominance plasticity in aging mice and after a cortical stroke.","In the primary visual cortex (V1)  monocular deprivation (MD) induces a shift in the ocular dominance (OD) of binocular neurons towards the open eye (Wiesel and Hubel  1963; Gordon and Stryker  1996). In V1 of C57Bl/6J mice  this OD-plasticity is maximal in juveniles  declines in adults and is absent beyond postnatal day (PD) 110 (Lehmann and Löwel  2008) if mice are raised in standard cages. Since it was recently shown that brief dark exposure (DE) restored OD-plasticity in young adult rats (PD70-100) (He et al.  2006)  we wondered whether DE would restore OD-plasticity also in adult and old mice and after a cortical stroke. To this end  we raised mice in standard cages until adulthood and transferred them to a darkroom for 10-14 days. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging we demonstrate that short-term DE can restore OD-plasticity after MD in both adult (PD138) and old mice (PD535)  and that OD-shifts were mediated by an increase of open eye responses in V1. Interestingly  restored OD-plasticity after DE was accompanied by a reduction of both parvalbumin expressing cells and perineuronal nets and was prevented by increasing intracortical inhibition with diazepam. DE also maintained OD-plasticity in adult mice (PD150) after a stroke in the primary somatosensory cortex. In contrast  short-term DE did not affect basic visual parameters as measured by optomotry. In conclusion  short-term DE was able to restore OD-plasticity in both adult and aging mice and even preserved plasticity after a cortical stroke  most likely mediated by reducing intracortical inhibition."
"87","25193744","The in vitro biokinetics of chlorpromazine and diazepam in aggregating rat brain cell cultures after repeated exposure.","Neurotoxic effects of compounds can be tested in vitro using cell systems. One example is aggregating rat brain cell cultures. For the extrapolation of in vitro data to the in vivo situation  it is important to take the biokinetics of the test compound into account. In addition  the exposure in vivo is often for a longer period of time; therefore  it is crucial to incorporate this into in vitro assays as well. In this study  aggregating rat brain cell cultures were exposed to chlorpromazine (CPZ) and diazepam (DZP) for 12-days with repeated exposure. Samples were taken from the stocks  test media  cell culture media and cells at specific time points on the first and last exposure day. These samples were analysed by HPLC-UV. The amount of CPZ in the medium decreased over time  whereas the amount in the cells showed an increase. Accumulation of CPZ in the cells was seen over the 12-day repeated exposure. The amount of DZP in the medium remained stable over time and only up to 2% of DZP added was found in the cells. Different biokinetic behaviour was found for CPZ and DZP. Possible explanations are differences in uptake into the cells or efflux out of the cells. The decrease of CPZ in the medium versus the stable amount of DZP results in differences in exposure concentrations over time  which should be taken into account when interpreting in vitro effect data."

The agonists GABA and muscimol gave EC50 values of 278 µm and 182 µm  respectively  and the presence of a GABAAR population displaying low agonist potencies is supported by strong RNA-seq signals for a2 and a3 subunits. GABAAR-mediated currents  evoked by EC50 concentrations of GABA  were blocked by bicuculline and picrotoxin with IC50 values of 2.7 and 5.1 µm  respectively. hECN GABAARs are predominantly <U+03B3> subunit-containing as assessed by the sensitivity of GABA-evoked currents to diazepam and insensitivity to Zn(2+)  together with the weak direct agonist action of gaboxadol; RNA-seq indicated a predominant expression of the <U+03B3>2 subunit. Potentiation of GABA-evoked currents by propofol and etomidate and the lack of inhibition of currents by salicylidine salycylhydrazide (SCS) indicate expression of the ß2 or ß3 subunit  with RNA-seq analysis indicating strong expression of ß3 in hECN GABAARs. Taken together our data support the notion that hECN GABAARs have an a2/3ß3<U+03B3>2 subunit composition - a composition that also predominates in immature rodent cortex. GlyRs expressed by hECNs were activated by glycine with an EC50 of 167 µm. Glycine-evoked (500 µm) currents were blocked by strychnine (IC50 = 630 nm) and picrotoxin (IC50 = 197 µm)  where the latter is suggestive of a population of heteromeric receptors. RNA-seq indicates GlyRs are likely to be composed of a2 and ß subunits."

Diazepam (DZP) is the current US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the cessation of nerve agent-induced SE. Here  we compared the efficacy of DZP with that of UBP302 [(S)-3-(2-carboxybenzyl)willardiine; an antagonist of the kainate receptors that contain the GluK1 subunit] against seizures  neuropathology  and behavioral deficits induced by soman in rats. DZP  administered 1 hour or 2 hours postexposure  terminated the SE  but seizures returned; thus  the total duration of SE within 24 hours after soman exposure was similar to (DZP at 1 hour) or longer than (DZP at 2 hours) that in the soman-exposed rats that did not receive the anticonvulsant. Compared with DZP  UBP302 stopped SE with a slower time course  but dramatically reduced the total duration of SE within 24 hours. Neuropathology and behavior were assessed in the groups that received anticonvulsant treatment 1 hour after exposure. UBP302  but not DZP  reduced neuronal degeneration in a number of brain regions  as well as neuronal loss in the basolateral amygdala and the CA1 hippocampal area  and prevented interneuronal loss in the basolateral amygdala. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the open field and by the acoustic startle response 30 days after soman exposure. The results showed that anxiety-like behavior was increased in the DZP-treated group and in the group that did not receive anticonvulsant treatment  but not in the UBP302-treated group. The results argue against the use of DZP for the treatment of nerve agent-induced seizures and brain damage and suggest that targeting GluK1-containing receptors is a more effective approach."

In another groups of animals  piperine was administered 30 min before subjecting them to immobilization stress for 6h. Antianxiety activity was evaluated by employing elevated plus maze  light-dark box and social interaction test. Diazepam was employed as standard anxiolytic drug.RESULTS: Piperine produced significant antianxiety-like activity in unstressed and stressed mice. The anxiolytic-like activity of piperine was comparable to diazepam. In unstressed mice  piperine significantly increased brain GABA levels  but could not produce any change in plasma nitrite levels. Meanwhile  in stressed mice  piperine did not produce any significant change in GABA levels  but significantly decreased nitrite levels. Pre-treatment with aminoguanidine (50mg/kg  ip)  an inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor  significantly potentiated the anxiolytic-like activity of piperine  as compared to piperine and aminoguanidine alone in stressed mice. On the other hand  pretreatment with 7-nitroindazole (20mg/kg  ip)  a neuronal NOS inhibitor significantly potentiated the antianxiety-like activity of piperine  as compared to piperine and 7-nitroindazole alone in unstressed mice.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the piperine produced significant anxiolytic activity in unstressed mice possibly through increase in GABA levels and inhibition of neuronal NOS. On the other hand  antianxiety activity in stressed mice might be through inhibition of inducible NOS."

We have studied the behavioural effects of ethanol in MK genetically deficient (MK-/-) and wild type (MK+/+) mice. A low dose of ethanol (1.0g/kg)  unable to cause conditioned place preference (CPP) in MK+/+ mice  induced a significant CPP in MK-/- mice  suggesting that MK prevents the rewarding effects of low doses of ethanol. However  this difference between genotypes is lost when a higher  rewarding  dose of ethanol (2.0g/kg) is used. Accordingly  the anxiolytic effects of 1.0mg/kg diazepam  other GABA(A) acting drug  were significantly enhanced in MK-/- mice compared to MK+/+ mice; however  2.0mg/kg diazepam caused increased anxiolytic effects in MK+/+ mice. In addition  MK-/- mice showed a significant delayed recovery from ethanol (2.0g/kg)-induced ataxia whereas the sedative effects induced by ethanol (3.6g/kg)  tested in a loss of righting reflex paradigm  were found to be similar in MK-/- and MK+/+ mice. The data indicate that MK differentially regulates the behavioural responses to ethanol. The results suggest that differences in the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to GABA(A) acting drugs caused by genetic inactivation of MK could underlie the different behavioural responses to ethanol in MK-/- mice. Overall  these results suggest that MK may be a novel genetic factor of importance in alcohol use disorders  and that potentiation of MK signalling pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of these disorders."

The importance of this layered organization for cortical processing and plasticity is little understood. We investigated the structure  function and plasticity of primary visual cortex (V1) of adult mice deficient for the glycoprotein reelin and their wild-type littermates. In V1 of rl-/- mice  cells with different laminar fates are present at all cortical depths. Surprisingly  the (vertically) disorganized cortex maintains a precise retinotopic (horizontal) organization. Rl-/- mice have normal basic visual capabilities  but are compromised in more challenging perceptual tasks  such as orientation discrimination. Additionally  rl-/- animals learn and memorize a visual task as well as their wild-type littermates. Interestingly  reelin deficiency enhances visual cortical plasticity: juvenile-like ocular dominance plasticity is preserved into late adulthood. The present data offer an important insight into the capabilities of a disorganized cortical system to maintain basic functional properties."

Male outbred rats were treated with either diazepam (4.0 mg/kg  i.p.) or vehicle for 30 days and then abruptly withdrawn for 48 h. Animals were tested in the elevated plus maze test. In addition  neurochemical shifts were evaluated in the selected brain structures (striatum  hippocampus  hypothalamus  and frontal cortex) during diazepam withdrawal. Withdrawn animals made fewer entries and spent less time on the open arms than did vehicle-treated rats and demonstrated a decrease in the dopamine level in striatum as compared with vehicle and diazepam-treated ones. Afobazole (5.0 mg/kg  i.p.) effectively (i) ameliorated withdrawal-induced anxiety  returning behavioral pattern in the elevated plus maze test up to levels comparable to that in vehicle-treated animals  and (ii) increased withdrawal-reduced dopamine level (+23.8%  p &lt; 0.05) in striatum.

Furthermore  we aimed to determine whether brain activation patterns correlated with the amelioration of social deficits through pharmacological intervention. The cingulate cortex  lateral septal nuclei  hypothalamus  thalamus and amygdala showed an increase in c-Fos immunoreactivity that was selective for exposure to social stimuli. NR1KD mice displayed a reduction in social behaviour and a reduction in c-Fos immunoreactivity in the cingulate cortex and septal nuclei. Acute clozapine did not significantly alter sociability; however  diazepam treatment did increase sociability and neuronal activation in the lateral septal region.

Osmolyte transporter expression greatly differed between cultured brain cells with highest mRNA expression levels for SMIT in astrocytes and TauT in neurons. BGT-1 mRNA and protein were expressed in microglia but not in astrocytes and neurons. In rat and human cerebral cortex  SMIT was expressed in astrocytes and TauT was found in neurons. Osmolyte transporter expression was subject to regulation by factors relevant for hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Hypoosmolarity  NH4Cl (0.5-5 mmol/l)  diazepam (10 µmol/l) and TNFa (10 ng/ml) time-dependently decreased mRNA expression of SMIT and/or TauT in cultured astrocytes. NH4Cl-induced SMIT/TauT mRNA expression changes were sensitive to inhibitors of glutamine synthetase and NADPH oxidase. In rat cerebral cortex  SMIT mRNA expression decreased after portal vein ligation or ammonium acetate injection probably due to astrocyte swelling in these HE animal models. It is concluded that osmolyte transporters are heterogeneously expressed in brain and are subject to regulation by HE-relevant factors."

Bath-applied VCD induced a specific  rapid  dose-dependent  and reversible slowing of the decay of mIPSCs (i.e.  increased time constant) with no effect on their frequency or amplitude. This is similar to the effect of BZDs on mIPSCs  but the effect of VCD persisted in the presence of the BZD-binding site antagonist flumazenil  and was additive to the effect of the BZD  diazepam. These data suggest that VCD acts through a different binding site than that of BZDs  which likely accounts for its effect on BZD-refractory SE.

Several evidences suggest a role of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in pathophysiology of epilepsy. Hesperidin (Hesp) acts as a powerful anti-oxidant agent against superoxide  singlet oxygen  and hydroxyl radicals. Thus  this study was undertaken to evaluate the possible neuroprotective mechanism of Hesp against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsions in mice.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty males Laca mice (20-25 g) were randomly divided into 10 treatment groups (n = 6). Seven days pretreatment of Hesp (100  200 mg/kg  p.o.) was carried out before PTZ (80 mg/kg  intraperitoneal [i.p.]) challenge  whereas diazepam (DZP) (0.2  0.5 mg/kg) and gabapentin (Gbp) (10  20 mg/kg) were administered i.p. 30 min before PTZ administration  that is  on 7(th) day. Following PTZ challenge  severity of convulsions (onset of jerks  myoclonic seizures  extensor phase and death)  brain anti-oxidant enzyme levels and mitochondrial complex enzymes activities were estimated.RESULTS: Single i.p. PTZ (80 mg/kg) challenge demonstrated severe convulsions  oxidative damage (raised lipid peroxidation [LPO]  nitrite concentration as well as depleted reduced glutathione  superoxide dismutase and catalase levels)  and depletion of mitochondrial enzyme Complex (I  II  IV) activities. Hesp (200 mg/kg)  DZP (0.5 mg/kg) and Gbp (20 mg/kg) pretreatments attenuated PTZ induced behavioral  biochemical and mitochondrial alterations. However  administration of Hesp (100 mg/kg) in combination with DZP (0.2 mg/kg) or Gbp (10 mg/kg) potentiated their neuroprotective effect  which was significant as compared to their effects in PTZ treated animals.CONCLUSION: Hesp possesses potent anticonvulsant activity which might be mediated through modulation of gamma-amino butyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor action."

Here  we investigated whether JM-20 protects against ischemic neuronal damage in vitro and in vivo. The effects of JM-20 were evaluated on hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). For in vivo studies  Wistar rats were subjected 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and oral administration of JM-20 at 2  4 and 8 mg/kg 1 h following reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after cerebral blood flow restoration  neurological deficits were scored  and the infarct volume  histopathological changes in cortex  number of hippocampal and striatal neurons  and glutamate/aspartate concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were measured. Susceptibility to brain mitochondrial swelling  membrane potential dissipation  H2O2 generation  cytochrome c release  Ca2+ accumulation  and morphological changes in the organelles were assessed 24 h post-ischemia. In vitro  JM-20 (1 and 10 µM) administered during reperfusion significantly reduced cell death in hippocampal slices subjected to OGD. In vivo  JM-20 treatment (4 and 8 mg/kg) significantly decreased neurological deficit scores  edema formation  total infarct volumes and histological alterations in different brain regions. JM-20 treatment also protected brain mitochondria from ischemic damage  most likely by preventing Ca2+ accumulation in organelles. Moreover  an 8-mg/kg JM-20 dose reduced glutamate and aspartate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid and the deleterious effects of MCAo even when delivered 8 h after blood flow restoration. These results suggest that in rats  JM-20 is a robust neuroprotective agent against ischemia/reperfusion injury with a wide therapeutic window. Our findings support the further examination of potential clinical JM-20 use to treat acute ischemic stroke."

For five P-gp substrates (indinavir  quinidine  loperamide  paclitaxel  and verapamil) and one nonsubstrate (diazepam)  in vitro P-gp transport activities were determined by measuring transcellular transport across monolayers of cynomolgus monkey P-gp-transfected LLC-PK1 and parental cells. In vivo P-gp functions at the BBB were reconstructed from in vitro P-gp transport activities and P-gp expression levels in transfected cells and cynomolgus brain microvessels. Brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (Kp brain) were reconstructed by integrating the reconstructed in vivo P-gp functions with drug unbound fractions in plasma and brain. For all compounds  the reconstructed Kp brain values were within a 3-fold range of observed values  as determined by constant intravenous infusion in adult cynomolgus monkeys. Among four factors  plasma unbound fraction was the most sensitive factor to species differences in Kp brain between monkeys and mice. Unbound brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (Kp uu brain) were reconstructed as the reciprocal of the reconstructed in vivo P-gp functions  and the reconstructed Kp uu brain values were within a 3-fold range of in vivo values  which were estimated from observed Kp brain and unbound fractions.

We investigated the HPA axis response following single-dose oral naltrexone administration in the early phase of alcohol withdrawal.METHODS: Cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) responses to naltrexone were measured in alcohol-dependent males (n=23) and in healthy males (n=20). Blood samples were collected for cortisol and ACTH measurements before administering (0<U+2009>min) 50<U+2009>mg naltrexone at 08.00 in the morning  and at 60  90  120 and 180<U+2009>min after administering naltrexone.RESULTS: Naltrexone administration resulted in a significant ACTH response in the patients while cortisol and ACTH responses were found to be significant in the controls. Cortisol response was not large enough to reach significance in the patients. ACTH level changes as a response to naltrexone in the patients were lower than that in the controls.DISCUSSION: The study revealed blunted cortisol and attenuated ACTH responses to naltrexone in early alcohol withdrawal. This study may have shown impairment in adrenal and pituitary levels during alcohol withdrawal."

BZDs are thought to act predominantly by affecting the gating of GABAA receptor channels  resulting in enhanced GABA-mediated currents in neurons. However  mutations mimicking the effect of BZDs on GABAAR channel gating have been shown to also impact the membrane dynamics and synaptic anchoring of the receptors. Here  using single molecule tracking combined with electrophysiological recordings  we show that BZD ligands rapidly influence the dynamic behavior of GABAARs in hippocampal neurons. Application of the inverse BZD agonist DMCM rapidly increased the diffusion and reduced the clustering of GABAARs at synapses  resulting in reduced postsynaptic currents. Conversely  the BZD full agonist diazepam had little effect at rest but reduced lateral diffusion and increased synaptic stabilization and clustering of GABAARs upon sustained neuronal activity  resulting in enhanced potency of inhibitory synapses. These effects occurred in the absence of detectable changes in gephyrin clusters  suggesting they did not reflect a rapid dispersion of the synaptic scaffold. Thus  alterations of the diffusion and synaptic anchoring of GABAARs represent a novel  unsuspected mechanism through which BZDs rapidly modulate GABA signaling in central neurons."

Y maze  Congo Red  and amyloid beta (Aß) immunochemistry were performed. We did not find any significant change in the navigation behavior of the exposed mice compared to the controls. Significantly less deposition of Aß in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice exposed to isoflurane  propofol  diazepam  ketamine  and pentobarbital was observed. In the dentate gyrus  Aß deposition was significantly greater in the group treated with pentobarbital. Congo Red staining evidenced significantly fewer fibrils in the cortex of mice exposed to diazepam  ketamine  or pentobarbital. The adopted repetitive exposure did not cause a significant detriment in Tg7526 mouse."

Male Albino Swiss mice were treated orally with vehicle 10 mL/kg  fluoxetine 20 mg/kg  imipramine 15 mg/kg  diazepam 1 mg/kg or oleanolic acid 5-40 mg/kg. Pretreatment (intraperitoneal) of animals with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) 20 mg/kg  1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4- (2-phthalimido) butyl]piperazine hydrobromide (NAN-190) 0.5 mg/kg  p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA) 100 mg/kg or a-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) 100 mg/kg  WAY100635 (WAY) 0.3 mg/kg  prazosin (PRAZ) 1 mg/kg  yohimbine 2 mg/kg as well as monoamine oxidase assay and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) quantification were carried out. Oleanolic acid potentiated the hypnotic effect of barbiturate and demonstrated an anxiolytic effect in both the light-dark box and elevated plus maze. This effect was not reversed by PTZ. Acute and/or chronic oral treatment of mice with oleanolic acid (5-20 mg/kg) elicited an antidepressant effect in the forced swimming test and the tail suspension test without interfering with the locomotor activity. The antidepressant effect of oleanolic acid was attenuated by NAN-190  AMPT  PCPA  WAY and PRAZ. Although monoamine oxidase activity remained unaltered by oleanolic acid  chronic administration of oleanolic acid augmented hippocampal BDNF level. These findings demonstrate multiple mechanisms of the anxiolytic and antidepressant effect of oleanolic acid."

Benzodiazepine exert their action via a high affinity-binding site at the a/<U+03B3> subunit interface on some of these receptors. Diazepam has sedative  hypnotic  anxiolytic  muscle relaxant  and anticonvulsant effects. It acts by potentiating the current evoked by the agonist GABA. Understanding specific interaction of benzodiazepines in the binding pocket of different GABAA receptor isoforms might help to separate these divergent effects. As a first step  we characterized the interaction between diazepam and the major GABAA receptor isoform a1ß2<U+03B3>2. We mutated several amino acid residues on the <U+03B3>2-subunit assumed to be located near or in the benzodiazepine binding pocket individually to cysteine and studied the interaction with three ligands that are modified with a cysteine-reactive isothiocyanate group (-NCS). When the reactive NCS group is in apposition to the cysteine residue this leads to a covalent reaction. In this way  three amino acid residues  <U+03B3>2Tyr58  <U+03B3>2Asn60  and <U+03B3>2Val190 were located relative to classical benzodiazepines in their binding pocket on GABAA receptors."

Here  we report changes of acetylcholine (ACh) release in the hippocampus before  during and after status epilepticus as monitored by microdialysis in unanesthetized rats. Administration of pilocarpine (30 mg/kg s.c.) to rats pretreated with lithium chloride (127 mg/kg i.p.) caused a massive  six-fold increase of hippocampal ACh release  paralleling the development of tonic seizures. When seizures were stopped by administration of diazepam (10 mg/kg i.p.) or ketamine (75 mg/kg i.p.)  ACh levels returned to normal. Extracellular concentrations of glutamate remained unchanged during this procedure. Administration of atropine (1 mg/kg i.p.) 2 h after pilocarpine caused a further increase of ACh but did not affect seizures  whereas injection of mecamylamine (5 mg/kg i.p.) reduced ACh levels and seizures in a delayed fashion. Local infusion of tetrodotoxin  1 µM locally) or hemicholinium (10 µM locally) strongly reduced ACh release and had delayed effects on seizures. Administration of glucose or inositol (250 mg/kg each i.p.) had no visible consequences. In parallel experiments  lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus also enhanced striatal ACh release  and hippocampal ACh levels equally increased when status epilepticus was induced by kainate (30 mg/kg i.p.). Taken together  our results demonstrate that seizure development in status epilepticus models is accompanied by massive increases of extracellular ACh  but not glutamate  levels. Treatments that reduce seizure activity also reliably reduce extracellular ACh levels."

The aim of the method is to reduce mental stress and associated mental processes by means of progressive suppression of muscle tension. The study was addressed to evaluate changes in brain glucose metabolism induced by PR in patients under a stressing state generated by a diagnostic medical intervention. The effect of PR was compared to a dose of sublingual diazepam  with the prediction that both interventions would be associated with a reduction in brain metabolism. Eighty-four oncological patients were assessed with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Maps of brain glucose distribution from 28 patients receiving PR were compared with maps from 28 patients receiving sublingual diazepam and with 28 patients with no treatment intervention. Compared to reference control subjects  the PR and diazepam groups showed a statistically significant  bilateral and generalized cortical hypometabolism. Regions showing the most prominent changes were the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. No significant differences were identified in the direct comparison between relaxation technique and sublingual diazepam. Our findings suggest that relaxation induced by a physical/psychological procedure can be as effective as a reference anxiolytic in reducing brain activity during a stressful state."

We studied expression and function of TMPAP (the transmembrane isoform of PAP) in the brain by utilizing mice deficient in TMPAP (PAP-/- mice). Here we report that TMPAP is expressed in a subpopulation of cerebral GABAergic neurons  and mice deficient in TMPAP show multiple behavioral and neurochemical features linked to hyperdopaminergic dysregulation and altered GABAergic transmission. In addition to increased anxiety  disturbed prepulse inhibition  increased synthesis of striatal dopamine  and augmented response to amphetamine  PAP-deficient mice have enlarged lateral ventricles  reduced diazepam-induced loss of righting reflex  and increased GABAergic tone in the hippocampus. TMPAP in the mouse brain is localized presynaptically  and colocalized with SNARE-associated protein snapin  a protein involved in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion  and PAP-deficient mice display altered subcellular distribution of snapin.

The neurochemical effects of benzodiazepine site agonists remain incompletely understood. Cholinergic neurotransmission modulates amygdala function  and this study tested the hypothesis that benzodiazepine site agonists alter acetylcholine (ACh) release in the amygdala.METHODS: Microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography quantified ACh release in the amygdala of Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 33). ACh was measured before and after IV administration (3 mg/kg) of midazolam or eszopiclone  with and without anesthesia. ACh in isoflurane-anesthetized rats during dialysis with Ringer's solution (control) was compared with ACh release during dialysis with Ringer's solution containing (100 µM) midazolam  diazepam  eszopiclone  or zolpidem.RESULTS: In unanesthetized rats  ACh in the amygdala was decreased by IV midazolam (-51.1%; P = 0.0029; 95% confidence interval [CI]  -73.0% to -29.2%) and eszopiclone (-39.6%; P = 0.0222; 95% CI  -69.8% to -9.3%). In anesthetized rats  ACh in the amygdala was decreased by IV administration of midazolam (-46.2%; P = 0.0041; 95% CI  -67.9% to -24.5%) and eszopiclone (-34.0%; P = 0.0009; 95% CI  -44.7% to -23.3%)  and increased by amygdala delivery of diazepam (43.2%; P = 0.0434; 95% CI  2.1% to 84.3%) and eszopiclone (222.2%; P = 0.0159; 95% CI  68.5% to 375.8%).CONCLUSIONS: ACh release in the amygdala was decreased by IV delivery of midazolam and eszopiclone. Dialysis delivery directly into the amygdala caused either increased (eszopiclone and diazepam) or likely no significant change (midazolam and zolpidem) in ACh release. These contrasting effects of delivery route on ACh release support the interpretation that systemically administered midazolam and eszopiclone decrease ACh release in the amygdala by acting on neuronal systems outside the amygdala."

While these hormones have been shown to modulate the anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam in some models  findings are inconsistent. Here  we tested for sex differences in response to anxiogenic stimuli following a 30-min diazepam (1.0mg/kg) pre-treatment in male and female rats showing high (HAn) and low (LAn) anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus maze. Acute diazepam administration resulted in decreased anxiety-like behavior only in HAn males as demonstrated by a significant increase in percent open arm time in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Immunohistochemical analysis for parvalbumin (PV; a calcium-binding protein that selectively stains GABAergic neurons) in central amygdala (CeA)  caudate putamen (CPu) and the hippocampus indicated the number of GABAergic interneurons in these areas differed across sex and anxiety trait. In the CPu  females had significantly more PV-immunoreactive (IR) cells than males  and LAn females had greater PV-IR neurons than HAn females. In the CeA  males displayed an increased number of PV-IR neurons compared to females  with no differences found between LAn and HAn. Further  trait differences were evident in the CA2 region of the hippocampus  regardless of sex. Taken together  these data suggest that gonadal hormones and trait anxiety may influence the sensitivity to the anti-anxiety effects of diazepam and these differences may be due in part to the distribution of GABA-containing interneurons."

Stress-related psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety are often comorbid with gastrointestinal function disorder  such as IBS. However  the mechanism of IBS still remains unknown. Curcumin is a biologically active phytochemical presents in turmeric and has pharmacological actions that benefit patients with depression and anxiety. Our study found that IBS rats showed depression- and anxiety-like behaviors associated with decreased 5-HT (serotonin)  BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and pCREB (phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein) expression in the hippocampus after chronic acute combining stress (CAS). However  these decreased parameters were obviously increased in the colonic after CAS. Curcumin (40 mg/kg) reduced the immobility time of forced swimming and the number of buried marbles in behavioral tests of CAS rats. Curcumin also decreased the number of fecal output and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores in response to graded distention. Moreover  curcumin increased serotonin  BDNF and pCREB levels in the hippocampus  but they were decreased in the colonic of CAS rats. 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist NAN-190 reversed the effects of curcumin on behaviors and the changes of intestine  pCREB and BDNF expression  which are related to IBS. These results suggested that curcumin exerts the effects on IBS through regulating neurotransmitters  BDNF and CREB signaling both in the brain and peripheral intestinal system."

This pharmacological property of diazepam led us to the idea that neurons that exhibit diazepam-sensitive  psychological stress-induced activation are potentially those recruited for stress responses. To obtain neuroanatomical clues for the central stress circuitries  we examined the effects of diazepam on psychological stress-induced neuronal activation in broad brain regions. Rats were exposed to a social defeat stress  which caused an abrupt increase in body temperature by up to 2°C. Pretreatment with diazepam (4mg/kg  i.p.) attenuated the stress-induced hyperthermia  confirming an inhibitory physiological effect of diazepam on the autonomic stress response. Subsequently  the distribution of cells expressing Fos  a marker of neuronal activation  was examined in 113 forebrain and midbrain regions of these rats after the stress exposure and diazepam treatment. The stress following vehicle treatment markedly increased Fos-immunoreactive (IR) cells in most regions of the cerebral cortex  limbic system  thalamus  hypothalamus and midbrain  which included parts of the autonomic  neuroendocrine  emotional and arousal systems. The diazepam treatment significantly reduced the stress-induced Fos expression in many brain regions including the prefrontal  sensory and motor cortices  septum  medial amygdaloid nucleus  medial and lateral preoptic areas  parvicellular paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus  dorsomedial hypothalamus  perifornical nucleus  tuberomammillary nucleus  association  midline and intralaminar thalami  and median and dorsal raphe nuclei.

Six patients with evident regression and severe psychomotor developmental delay after encephalopathy were included in the severe group  while the remaining 4 patients with mild mental retardation were included in the mild group. We retrospectively analyzed their clinical symptoms  laboratory data  and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) findings.RESULTS: Patients in the severe group developed subsequent complications such as epilepsy and severe motor impairment. Univariate analysis revealed that higher maximum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (p=0.055) were a weak predictor of poor outcome. Maximum creatinine levels were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) and minimal platelet counts were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) in the severe group than in the mild group. Acute renal failure was not observed in any patient throughout the study. MRS of the BTA lesion during the BTA period showed elevated lactate levels in 5 children in the severe group and 1 child in the mild group. MRI performed during the chronic phase revealed severe brain atrophy in all patients in the severe group.CONCLUSIONS: Higher creatinine and LDH levels and lower platelet counts in the acute phase correlated with poor prognosis. Increased lactate levels in the BTA lesion during the BTA period on MRS may predict severe physical and mental disability."

Exposure to POX produces high mortality. OP poisoning is often associated with chronic neurological disorders. In this study  we optimize a rat survival model of lethal POX exposures in order to mimic both acute and long-term effects of POX intoxication. Male Sprague-Dawley rats injected with POX (4mg/kg  ice-cold PBS  s.c.) produced a rapid cholinergic crisis that evolved into status epilepticus (SE) and death within 6-8min. The EEG profile for POX induced SE was characterized and showed clinical and electrographic seizures with 7-10Hz spike activity. Treatment of 100% lethal POX intoxication with an optimized three drug regimen (atropine  2mg/kg  i.p.  2-PAM  25mg/kg  i.m. and diazepam  5mg/kg  i.p.) promptly stopped SE and reduced acute mortality to 12% and chronic mortality to 18%. This model is ideally suited to test effective countermeasures against lethal POX exposure. Animals that survived the POX SE manifested prolonged elevations in hippocampal [Ca(2+)]i (Ca(2+) plateau) and significant multifocal neuronal injury. POX SE induced Ca(2+) plateau had its origin in Ca(2+) release from intracellular Ca(2+) stores since inhibition of ryanodine/IP3 receptor lowered elevated Ca(2+) levels post SE. POX SE induced neuronal injury and alterations in Ca(2+) dynamics may underlie some of the long term morbidity associated with OP toxicity."

TMS of the primary motor cortex elicits a sequence of TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs). It is thought that inhibitory neurotransmission through GABA-A receptors (GABAAR) modulates early TEPs (&lt;50 ms after TMS)  whereas GABA-B receptors (GABABR) play a role for later TEPs (at ~100 ms after TMS). However  the physiological underpinnings of TEPs have not been clearly elucidated yet. Here  we studied the role of GABAA/B-ergic neurotransmission for TEPs in healthy subjects using a pharmaco-TMS-EEG approach. In Experiment 1  we tested the effects of a single oral dose of alprazolam (a classical benzodiazepine acting as allosteric-positive modulator at a1  a2  a3  and a5 subunit-containing GABAARs) and zolpidem (a positive modulator mainly at the a1 GABAAR) in a double-blind  placebo-controlled  crossover study. In Experiment 2  we tested the influence of baclofen (a GABABR agonist) and diazepam (a classical benzodiazepine) versus placebo on TEPs. Alprazolam and diazepam increased the amplitude of the negative potential at 45 ms after stimulation (N45) and decreased the negative component at 100 ms (N100)  whereas zolpidem increased the N45 only. In contrast  baclofen specifically increased the N100 amplitude. These results provide strong evidence that the N45 represents activity of a1-subunit-containing GABAARs  whereas the N100 represents activity of GABABRs. Findings open a novel window of opportunity to study alteration of GABAA-/GABAB-related inhibition in disorders  such as epilepsy or schizophrenia."
"117","24723854","Delta-subunit-containing GABAA-receptors mediate tonic inhibition in paracapsular cells of the mouse amygdala.","The intercalated paracapsular cells (pcs) are small GABAergic interneurons that form densely populated clusters surrounding the basolateral (BLA) complex of the amygdala. Their main task in the amygdala circuitry appears to be the control of information flow  as they act as an inhibitory interface between input and output nuclei. Modulation of their activity is thus thought to affect amygdala output and the generation of fear and anxiety. Recent evidence indicates that pcs express benzodiazepine (BZ)-sensitive GABAA receptor (GABAAR) variants containing the a2- and a3-subunit for transmission of post-synaptic currents  yet little is known about the expression of extrasynaptic GABAARs  mediating tonic inhibition and regulating neuronal excitability. Here  we show that pcs from the lateral and medial intercalated cell cluster (l- and mITC  respectively) express a tonic GABAergic conductance that could be significantly increased in a concentration-dependent manner by the d-preferring GABAAR agonist THIP (0.5-10 µM)  but not by the BZ diazepam (1 µM). The neurosteroid THDOC (300 nM) also increased tonic currents in pcs significantly  but only in the presence of additional GABA (5 µM). Immunohistochemical stainings revealed that both the d-GABAAR and the a4-GABAAR subunit are expressed throughout all ITCs  while no staining for the a5-GABAAR subunit could be detected. Moreover  1 µM THIP dampened excitability in pcs most likely by increasing shunting inhibition. In line with this  THIP significantly decreased lITC-generated inhibition in target cells residing in the BLA nucleus by 30%. Taken together these results demonstrate for the first time that pcs express a tonic inhibitory conductance mediated most likely by a4/d-containing GABAARs. This data also suggest that d-GABAAR targeting compounds might possibly interfere with pcs-related neuronal processes such as fear extinction."

However  the demonstration of a true physiological role of DBI and its fragments has only recently been reported. Based on DBI gain- and loss-of-function experiments in vivo  DBI and its fragment ODN were found to promote neurogenesis in the subventricular zone in vivo. Acting as NAM on GABAA receptors of precursor cells  DBI counteracted the inhibitory effect of GABA and thereby enhanced the proliferation of these cells (Alfonso et al. in Cell Stem Cell 10:76-87  2012). Conversely and most remarkably  in similar gain- and loss-of-function experiments in the thalamus  the DBI gene products acted as positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of GABAA receptors in prolonging the duration of IPSCs  an effect which was specific for GABA transmission within the reticular nucleus (nRT) (Christian et al. in Neuron 78:1063-1074  2013). Since intra-nRT potentiation of GABA transmission by benzodiazepine drugs exerts powerful anti-oscillatory effects  DBI might be endogenously effective by modulating seizure susceptibility. It remains to be seen by which mechanism both NAM and PAM activity can arise from the Dbi gene. Nevertheless  the results open new perspectives on the regionally distinct endogenous modulation of GABA transmission via the benzodiazepine site."

Diazepam was administered immediately via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection after inducing HIBD at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1)8h(-1) for three consecutive days. Three days after HIBD  rats were decapitated  and the extent of brain injury was evaluated using 2 3 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Additionally  the expression of Potassium-chloride cotransporter-2 (KCC2) was analysed using real-time PCR  Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Three weeks after HIBD  rats were subjected to the Morris water maze (MWM) test and the locomotor activity test to determine the long-term therapeutic effects of Diazepam. We observed that the volume of infarction in the Diazepam group was significantly less (P&lt;0.01) compared with the HIBD group. We also observed that the learning and memory abilities of the Diazepam rats improved significantly compared with the untreated rats (P&lt;0.05) and that the decrease in KCC2 expression was prevented (P&lt;0.01). Early treatment with Diazepam appears to attenuate HIBD and can efficiently improve the long-term learning and memory capabilities of the animal. A potential mechanism underlying these effects may involve preventing the decrease in KCC2 expression."

Withdrawal of 2mg/kg diazepam after 28  but not after 14 or 21 days of administration led to an anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. Antagonism of the diazepam effects at a1-containing GABAA receptors  achieved by daily administration of the neutral modulator ßCCt (5mg/kg)  did not affect the anxiety level during withdrawal. An increased susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizures was observed during diazepam withdrawal after 21 and 28 days of treatment. Daily co-administration of ßCCt further decreased the PTZ-seizure threshold after 21 days of treatment  whilst it prevented the diazepam withdrawal-elicited decrease of the PTZ threshold after 28 days of treatment. In conclusion  the current study suggests that the role of a1-containing GABAA receptors in mediating the development of physical dependence may vary based on the effect being studied and duration of protracted treatment. Moreover  the present data supports previous findings that the lack of activity at a1-containing GABAA receptors is not sufficient to eliminate physical dependence liability of ligands of the benzodiazepine type."

CIE treatment and withdrawal (&gt;40 days) produced decreases in the ethanol and Ro15-4513 potentiation of extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs  which mediate the picrotoxin-sensitive tonic current (I(tonic))  while potentiation of synaptic receptors  which give rise to miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs)  was increased. Diazepam sensitivity of both I(tonic) and mIPSCs was decreased by CIE treatment. The average magnitude of I(tonic) was unchanged  but mIPSC amplitude and frequency decreased and mIPSC rise time increased after CIE treatment. Rise-time histograms revealed decreased frequency of fast-rising mIPSCs after CIE treatment  consistent with possible decreases in somatic GABAergic synapses in MSNs from CIE rats. However  unbiased stereological analysis of NeuN-stained NAcc neurons did not detect any decreases in NAcc volume  neuronal numbers  or neuronal cell body volume. Western blot analysis of surface subunit levels revealed selective decreases in a1 and d and increases in a4  a5  and <U+03B3>2 GABA(A)R subunits after CIE treatment and withdrawal. Similar  but reversible  alterations occurred after a single ethanol dose (5 g/kg). These data reveal CIE-induced long-lasting neuroadaptations in the NAcc GABAergic neurotransmission."

The vascular volume (Vvasc) was sub-normal in 3xTg-AD mice aged from 6 to 18 months  but not in the APP/PS1 mice. The uptakes of [(3)H]-diazepam by the brains of 3xTg-AD  APP/PS1 and their age-matched control mice were similar at all the times studied  suggesting that the simple diffusion of small solutes is unchanged in transgenic animals. The uptake of d-glucose by the brains of 18-month old 3xTg-AD mice  but not by those of 8-month old APP/PS1 mice  was reduced compared to their age-matched controls. Accordingly  the amount of Glut-1 protein was 1.4 times lower in the brain capillaries of 18 month-old 3xTg-AD mice than in those of age-matched control mice. We conclude that the brain vascular volume is reduced early in 3xTg-AD mice  6 months before the appearance of pathological lesions  and that this reduction persists until they are at least 18 months old. The absence of alterations in the BBB of APP/PS1 mice suggests that hyperphosphorylated tau proteins contribute to the vascular changes that occur in AD."

However  molecular biomarkers and targeted therapies for immune cell activation in these disorders are currently lacking. To address this  we investigated the involvement and role of translocator protein (TSPO)  a biomarker of microglial and astrocyte gliosis in brain degeneration  in the context of retinal inflammation. Here  we find that TSPO is acutely and specifically upregulated in retinal microglia in separate mouse models of retinal inflammation and injury. Concomitantly  its endogenous ligand  diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI)  is upregulated in the macroglia of the mouse retina such as astrocytes and Müller cells. In addition  we discover that TSPO-mediated signaling in microglia via DBI-derived ligands negatively regulates features of microglial activation  including reactive oxygen species production  TNF-a expression and secretion  and microglial proliferation. The inducibility and effects of DBI-TSPO signaling in the retina reveal a mechanism of coordinated macroglia-microglia interactions  the function of which is to limit the magnitude of inflammatory responses after their initiation  facilitating a return to baseline quiescence. Our results indicate that TSPO is a promising molecular marker for imaging inflammatory cell activation in the retina and highlight DBI-TSPO signaling as a potential target for immodulatory therapies."
"125","24534003","Vertical allometry: fact or fiction?","In pharmacokinetics  vertical allometry is referred to the clearance of a drug when the predicted human clearance is substantially higher than the observed human clearance. Vertical allometry was initially reported for diazepam based on a 33-fold higher human predicted clearance than the observed human clearance. In recent years  it has been found that many other drugs besides diazepam  can be classified as drugs which exhibit vertical allometry. Over the years  many questions regarding vertical allometry have been raised. For example  (1) How to define and identify the vertical allometry? (2) How much difference should be between predicted and observed human clearance values before a drug could be declared 'a drug which follows vertical allometry'? (3) If somehow one can identify vertical allometry from animal data  how this information can be used for reasonably accurate prediction of clearance in humans? This report attempts to answer the aforementioned questions. The concept of vertical allometry at this time remains complex and obscure but with more extensive works one can have better understanding of 'vertical allometry'."

Overall  zolpidem purportedly has fewer instances of abuse and dependence than traditionally used benzodiazepines. However  several studies have shown that zolpidem may be more similar to benzodiazepines in terms of behavioral tolerance and withdrawal symptoms.OBJECTIVES: In the current study  we examined whether subchronic zolpidem or diazepam administration produced deficits in zolpidem's locomotor-impairing effects  anxiety-like behaviors  and changes in GABAAR subunit messenger RNA (mRNA).METHODS: Mice were given subchronic injections of either zolpidem (10 mg/kg)  diazepam (20 mg/kg)  or vehicle twice daily for 7 days. On day 8  mice were given a challenge dose of zolpidem (2 mg/kg) or vehicle before open field testing. Another set of mice underwent the same injection regimen but were sacrificed on day 8 for qRT-PCR analysis.RESULTS: We found that subchronic zolpidem and diazepam administration produced deficits in the acute locomotor-impairing effects of zolpidem and increased anxiety-like behaviors 1 day after drug termination. In addition  we found that subchronic treatment of zolpidem and diazepam induced distinct but overlapping GABAAR subunit mRNA changes in the cortex but few changes in the hippocampus  amygdala  or prefrontal cortex. Levels of mRNA measured in separate mice after a single injection of either zolpidem or diazepam revealed no mRNA changes.CONCLUSIONS: In mice  subchronic treatment of zolpidem and diazepam can produce deficits in the locomotor-impairing effects of zolpidem  anxiety-like withdrawal symptoms  and subunit-specific mRNA changes."

We report on SH-I-048A  a newly synthesized chiral positive modulator of GABAA receptors characterized by exceptional subnanomolar affinity  high efficacy and non-selectivity. Its influence on behavior was assessed in Wistar rats and contrasted to that obtained with 2mg/kg diazepam. SH-I-048A reached micromolar concentrations in brain tissue  while the unbound fraction in brain homogenate was around 1.5%. The approximated electrophysiological responses  which estimated free concentrations of SH-I-048A or diazepam are able to elicit  suggested a similarity between the 10mg/kg dose of the novel ligand and 2mg/kg diazepam; however  SH-I-048A was relatively more active at a1- and a5-containing GABAA receptors. Behaviorally  SH-I-048A induced sedative  muscle relaxant and ataxic effects  reversed mechanical hyperalgesia 24h after injury  while it was devoid of clear anxiolytic actions and did not affect water-maze performance. While lack of clear anxiolytic actions may be connected with an enhanced potentiation at a1-containing GABAA receptors  the observed behavior in the rotarod  water maze and peripheral nerve injury tests was possibly affected by its prominent action at receptors containing the a5 subunit. The current results encourage further innovative approaches aimed at linking in vitro and in vivo data in order to help define fine-tuning mechanisms at four sensitive receptor populations that underlie subtle differences in behavioral profiles of benzodiazepine site ligands."

Serum content  glioma conditioned medium and inhibitors probenecid and verapamil influenced resulted permeability significantly. Basic differences of transport properties of the investigated NSAIDs were similar comparing all three in vitro BBB models. Different substance combinations in the group studies and addition of probenecid and verapamil suggested that transporter proteins are involved in the transport of every tested NSAID. Results especially underlined the importance of same experimental conditions (transport medium  serum content  species origin  cell line) for proper data comparison."

The present study explored the impact of withdrawal from repeated haloperidol (HAL) treatment  as well as the response to a novel a5 gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor positive allosteric modulator (a5PAM)  on the activity of the DA system in the methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia. Electrophysiological recordings were conducted from DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area of MAM and saline (SAL) rats following 7-day withdrawal from repeated HAL (21 d  0.6 mg/kg  orally). In separate animals  amphetamine-induced locomotion was measured to assess changes in DA behavioral sensitivity. SAL rats withdrawn from HAL demonstrated reduced spontaneous DA neuron activity along with an enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine  indicative of the development of DA supersensitivity. Both a5PAM treatment and ventral hippocampal (vHPC) inactivation reversed the DA neuron depolarization block following HAL withdrawal in SAL rats. In contrast  MAM rats withdrawn from HAL exhibited reduced spontaneous DA activity and enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine compared with untreated SAL rats; however  this condition was unresponsive to a5PAM treatment or vHPC inactivation. Withdrawal from prior HAL treatment interferes with the therapeutic actions of this novel treatment in the MAM model of schizophrenia. Consequently  testing novel compounds on chronically treated schizophrenia patients may be ineffective."

Mitragynine doses used in this study were selected on the basis of approximately human equivalent doses with reference to our previous literature reports. Acute administration of mitragynine (10  20 and 40 mg/kg) or diazepam (10 mg/kg) increased central zone and open arms exploration in the open-field and elevated plus-maze tests respectively.

For behavioral studies  and in vivo antioxidant analyses  mice were treated orally with 0.05% Tween 80 dissolved in 0.9% saline solution (vehicle)  ascorbic acid 250 mg/kg  diazepam (2 mg/kg) and EL (25  50 and 75 mg/kg). Results suggest an anxiolytic effect of (+)-limonene epoxide. A reduction in number of buried marbles in groups treated with EL doses of 25  50 and 75 mg/kg was observed when compared with diazepam and vehicle groups. This reduction was observed after treatments with single and repeated doses  reinforcing the hypothesis of anxiolytic effect. The anxiolytic effect was reversed by pretreatment with flumazenil (25 mg/kg  o.r) in the same way as it was observed with diazepam (2 mg/kg  o.r  positive control)  suggesting that these drugs possess a similar mechanism of action. In antioxidant tests in vitro  the concentrations from 0.9 to 7.2 µg/ml were tested. The results of in vitro antioxidant tests demonstrated a 50% inhibitory effective concentration of 0.7342  1.296 and 1.169 µg/ml against the formation of nitrite ion  hydroxyl radical and reactive substances to thiobarbituric acid  respectively. The treatment with EL reduced the lipid peroxidation level and nitrite content  suggesting an antioxidant role in vivo since it was able to reduce the formation of reactive species derived from oxygen and nitrogen. Furthermore  the EL increased activity of enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase in mice hippocampus  suggesting that their role may be due to antioxidant upregulation of these enzymes."

An enriched environment (EE) promotes OD plasticity in adult rats. Here  we explored cellular mechanisms of EE in mouse V1 and the therapeutic potential of EE to prevent impairments of plasticity after a cortical stroke. Using in vivo optical imaging  we observed that monocular deprivation in adult EE mice (i) caused a very strong OD plasticity previously only observed in 4-wk-old animals  (ii) restored already lost OD plasticity in adult SC-raised mice  and (iii) preserved OD plasticity after a stroke in the primary somatosensory cortex. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology in vitro  we also show that (iv) local inhibition was significantly reduced in V1 slices of adult EE mice and (v) the GABA/AMPA ratio was like that in 4-wk-old SC-raised animals. These observations were corroborated by in vivo analyses showing that diazepam treatment significantly reduced the OD shift of EE mice after monocular deprivation. Taken together  EE extended the sensitive phase for OD plasticity into late adulthood  rejuvenated V1 after 4 mo of SC-rearing  and protected adult mice from stroke-induced impairments of cortical plasticity. The EE effect was mediated most likely by preserving low juvenile levels of inhibition into adulthood  which potentially promoted adaptive changes in cortical circuits."

The present study aimed to reveal the molecular mechanisms that may contribute to the effects of BZs in the hippocampus (HIP)  an area involved in drug-related plasticity  by investigating the regulation of immediate early genes following BZ administration. Previous studies have demonstrated that both brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and c-Fos contribute to memory- and abuse-related processes that occur within the HIP  and their expression is altered in response to BZ exposure. In the current study  mice received acute or repeated administration of BZs and HIP tissue was analyzed for alterations in BDNF and c-Fos expression. Although no significant changes in BDNF or c-Fos were observed in response to twice-daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of diazepam (10 mg/kg + 5 mg/kg) or zolpidem (ZP; 2.5 mg/kg + 2.5 mg/kg)  acute i.p. administration of both triazolam (0.03 mg/kg) and ZP (1.0 mg/kg) decreased BDNF protein levels within the HIP relative to vehicle  without any effect on c-Fos. ZP specifically reduced exon IV-containing BDNF transcripts with a concomitant increase in the association of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) with BDNF promoter IV  suggesting that MeCP2 activity at this promoter may represent a ZP-specific mechanism for reducing BDNF expression. ZP also increased the association of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) with BDNF promoter I. Future work should examine the interaction between ZP and DNA as the cause for altered gene expression in the HIP  given that BZs can enter the nucleus and intercalate into DNA directly."

We continuously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) and measured plasma corticosterone levels to develop a mouse FNE model by inducing acute insomnia in mice that have been placed in unfamiliar cage environments. The sleep latency of mice 'moved to clean cages' (MCC) was longer than that for mice 'moved to dirty ones' (MDC). As compared to MDC mice  MCC mice showed stronger decreases in the amount of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM  NREM) and REM sleep  with a lower power density of NREM sleep  increased fragmentation and decreased stage transitions from NREM sleep to wake  and higher variation in plasma corticosterone levels. Treatment of MCC mice with zolpidem  diazepam  raclopride  pyrilamine  except SCH23390 shortened NREM sleep latency. In addition  zolpidem significantly increased NREM and REM sleep with the increase in slow wave activity (1.00-2.75 Hz)  while raclopride significantly increased NREM and REM sleep without changing the EEG power density in MCC mice  whereas diazepam increased sleep with a drastic decrease in power density of the frequency band between 1.00 and 4.00 Hz  diazepam also increased the frequency band between 9.75 and 24.75 Hz during NREM sleep. These results indicate that a MCC mouse can mimic a FNE phenotype of humans and that zolpidem and raclopride may be useful drugs to prevent acute insomnia  including FNE."

These areas are normally under tonic inhibition by GABA containing neurons that may be deficient in Schlager hypertensive mice as suggested by microarray analysis. In the present study  cardiovascular effects of chronic activation of GABAA receptors were examined in BPH/2J mice.METHODS: Male normotensive BPN/3J and hypertensive BPH/2J mice were administered diazepam in drinking water for 7 days. BP  heart rate and locomotor activity were recorded by telemetry.RESULTS: Diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) reduced BP of BPN/3J mice during the night-time by -7.1 ± 2.0 mmHg (P = 0.001) but had no effect in BPH/2J mice (+2 ± 2 mmHg) and no effect on heart rate or locomotor activity in either strain. Diazepam reduced the responses to restraint stress in BPN/3J mice by 20% (P = 0.01) and there was no association between Fos-immunoreactive neurons and neurons expressing GABAA receptors or neuropeptide Y in the medial amygdala and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. By contrast diazepam had no effect on the pressor response to stress in BPH/2J mice and ~50% of stress-activated neurons in these regions also expressed GABAA receptors and ~45% were neuropeptide Y-containing.CONCLUSION: These findings show that BPH/2J mice are resistant to the effects of diazepam and suggest that GABAA receptor dysfunction in BPH/2J mice may be contributing to the neurogenic hypertension by not suppressing arousal-induced sympathetic activation within amygdala and hypothalamic nuclei."
"137","24262146","Astrocytes potentiate GABAergic transmission in the thalamic reticular nucleus via endozepine signaling.","Emerging evidence indicates that diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) mediates an endogenous benzodiazepine-mimicking (endozepine) effect on synaptic inhibition in the thalamic reticular nucleus (nRT). Here we demonstrate that DBI peptide colocalizes with both astrocytic and neuronal markers in mouse nRT  and investigate the role of astrocytic function in endozepine modulation in this nucleus by testing the effects of the gliotoxin fluorocitrate (FC) on synaptic inhibition and endozepine signaling in the nRT using patch-clamp recordings. FC treatment reduced the effective inhibitory charge of GABAA receptor (GABAAR)-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in WT mice  indicating that astrocytes enhance GABAAR responses in the nRT. This effect was abolished by both a point mutation that inhibits classical benzodiazepine binding to GABAARs containing the a3 subunit (predominant in the nRT) and a chromosomal deletion that removes the Dbi gene. Thus  astrocytes are required for positive allosteric modulation via the a3 subunit benzodiazepine-binding site by DBI peptide family endozepines. Outside-out sniffer patches pulled from neurons in the adjacent ventrobasal nucleus  which does not contain endozepines  show a potentiated response to laser photostimulation of caged GABA when placed in the nRT. FC treatment blocked the nRT-dependent potentiation of this response  as did the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil. When sniffer patches were placed in the ventrobasal nucleus  however  subsequent treatment with FC led to potentiation of the uncaged GABA response  suggesting nucleus-specific roles for thalamic astrocytes in regulating inhibition. Taken together  these results suggest that astrocytes are required for endozepine actions in the nRT  and as such can be positive modulators of synaptic inhibition."

It has been proposed that the neuronal network reorganization that occurs during latency determines the subsequent appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures. The aim of this study was to evaluate neuronal and glial responses during the latency period that follows SE. Given the potential role of astrocytes in the post-SE network reorganization  through the secretion of synaptogenic molecules such as thrombospondins  we also studied the effect of treatment with the a2d1 thrombospondin receptor antagonist gabapentin. Adult male Wistar rats received 3 mEq/kg LiCl  and 20 h later 30 mg/kg pilocarpine. Once SE was achieved  seizures were stopped with 20 mg/kg diazepam. Animals then received 400 mg/kg/day gabapentin or saline for either 4 or 14 days. In vitro experiments were performed in dissociated mixed hippocampal cell culture exposed to glutamate  and subsequently treated with gabapentin or vehicle. During the latency period  the hippocampus and pyriform cortex of SE-animals presented a profuse reactive astrogliosis  with increased GFAP and nestin expression. Gliosis intensity was dependent on the Racine stage attained by the animals and peaked 15 days after SE. Microglia was also reactive after SE  and followed the same pattern. Neuronal degeneration was present in SE-animals  and also depended on the Racine stage and the SE duration. Polysialic-acid NCAM (PSA-NCAM) expression was increased in hippocampal CA-1 and dentate gyrus of SE-animals. Gabapentin treatment was able to reduce reactive gliosis  decrease neuronal loss and normalize PSA-NCAM staining in hippocampal CA-1. In vitro  gabapentin treatment partially prevented the dendritic loss and reactive gliosis caused by glutamate excitotoxicity. Our results show that gabapentin treatment during the latency period after SE protects neurons and normalizes PSA-NCAM probably by direct interaction with neurons and glia."

Based on the previous work  we developed and patented an anti-anxiety herbal formula Fu Fang Jin Jing Oral Liquid (FJJOL) with Herba Rhodiolae as a chief ingredient. In this study  the anti-hypoxia and anti-anxiety effects of FJJOL in a high altitude forced-swimming mouse model with anxiety symptoms will be elucidated by NMR-based metabolomics.METHODS: In our experiments  the mice were divided randomly into four groups as flatland group  high altitude saline-treated group  high altitude FJJOL-treated group  and high altitude diazepam-treated group. To cause anxiety effects and hypoxic defects  a combination use of oxygen level decreasing (hypobaric cabin) and oxygen consumption increasing (exhaustive swimming) were applied to mice. After a three-day experimental handling  aqueous metabolites of mouse brain tissues were extracted and then subjected to NMR analysis. The therapeutic effects of FJJOL on the hypobaric hypoxia mice with anxiety symptoms were verified.RESULTS: Upon hypoxic exposure  both energy metabolism defects and disorders of functional metabolites in brain tissues of mice were observed. PCA  PLS-DA and OPLS-DA scatter plots revealed a clear group clustering for metabolic profiles in the hypoxia versus normoxia samples. After a three-day treatment with FJJOL  significant rescue effects on energy metabolism were detected  and levels of ATP  fumarate  malate and lactate in brain tissues of hypoxic mice recovered. Meanwhile  FJJOL also up-regulated the neurotransmitter GABA  and the improvement of anxiety symptoms was highly related to this effect.CONCLUSIONS: FJJOL ameliorated hypobaric hypoxia effects by regulating energy metabolism  choline metabolism  and improving the symptoms of anxiety. The anti-anxiety therapeutic effects of FJJOL were comparable to the conventional anti-anxiety drug diazepam on the hypobaric hypoxia mice. FJJOL might serve as an alternative therapy for the hypoxia and anxiety disorders."

MSG-treated rats at 8 weeks old were given NS  diazepam  or RRPPs daily for seven consecutive days by intragastric administration  while NS-treated rats given the same volume of NS. Elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/dark transition (LDT) tests were used to observe anti-anxiety effects of RRPPs at 1 h after the last administration. After EPM and LDT tests  hippocampus tissues were excised on ice rapidly from the brains of rats. Thereafter  2-DE and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) were used for detecting differential proteins in hippocampus of rats so as to explore the potential mechanisms.RESULTS: RRPPs (200  400 mg/kg) could significantly inhibit MSG-induced decrease of time and entries percentages in open zones in EPM test and numbers of light-dark transition in LDT test.

The characterization revealed the small spherical droplets in the range 195 -220 nm with polydispersity index below 0.15 and zeta potential between -30 and - 60 mV. Interactions among the investigated factors  rather than factors alone  were shown to more profoundly affect nanoemulsion characteristics. In vivo pharmacokinetic study of selected diazepam nanoemulsions with different oil content (20%  30%  and 40%  w/w) demonstrated fast and intense initial distribution into rat brain of diazepam from nanoemulsions with 20% and 30% (w/w) oil content  suggesting their applicability in urgent situations."

Of particular interest is OCT3 expression and function in the brain  where it plays a role in serotonin clearance and influences mood and behavior. Protein kinase signaling mediates rapid modulation of cerebral processes  but little is known about acute regulation of OCT3 by protein kinases. Therefore  we cloned mouse OCT3 (mOCT3) and generated a human embryonic kidney cell line stably expressing the transporter to study transport characteristics  acute regulation by protein kinases  and interaction with psychotropic drugs. Uptake measurement was performed using the fluorescent cation 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (ASP(+)  1 µM) as a substrate. The translational value of these findings was determined by comparing results obtained with cloned mouse and human OCT3. mOCT3-mediated transport is membrane potential dependent and pH independent. ASP(+) uptake by mOCT3 and human OCT3 (hOCT3) was efficiently inhibited by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium  tetrapentylammonium (TPA(+))  corticosterone  serotonin  and histamine and by the drugs ketamine  fluoxetine  and diazepam. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations of mOCT3 and hOCT3 for TPA(+)  serotonin  diazepam  and ketamine are significantly different. Diazepam is a non-transported inhibitor. Furthermore  the activities of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are acutely regulated by the p56 (lck) tyrosine kinase by decreasing their V max. Studies with freshly isolated renal proximal tubules from mOCT1/2(-/-) mice  in which mOCT3 is the only OCT present  confirmed this regulation pathway. Only the activity of hOCT3 is regulated by calmodulin. These findings suggest that even though many transport properties of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are similar  there are also species-specific aspects of OCT3 function."

Glabridin is a major flavonoid component from licorice which we evaluated by examining GABA responses in acutely isolated dorsal raphe neurons of the rat. Neurons were recorded with patch-clamp methods at a holding potential of - 50 mV. Glabridin potentiated GABA-induced responses by positively modulating GABAA receptor responses with different concentration range. GABA (2 × 10(-6) M)-evoked currents were potentiated in a stepwise pattern increasing glabridin concentration. Between 10(-12) and 10(-8) M glabridin increased GABA responses by about 140 % of the control. At concentrations above 10(-7) M  a much larger  dose-dependent potentiation occurred before reaching a plateau at 3 × 10-6 M glabridin. A hypnotic drug  zolpidem  also induced biphasic concentration-potentiation relationship. The glabridin potentiation ratio was 2.2 times larger than the maximum potentiation to the benzodiazepine receptor full agonist diazepam. Benzodiazepine receptor antagonist  flumazenil (3 × 10(-7) M)  failed to inhibit glabridin (3 × 10(-7) M)-induced potentiation. This result implies that glabridin may exhibit sedative and hypnotic effects by potentiating GABAergic inhibition in dorsal raphe neurons by GABAA receptor actions."
"148","23963779","Diazepam treatment blocks the elevation of hippocampal activity and the accelerated proliferation of hippocampal neural stem cells after focal cerebral ischemia in mice.","Hippocampal neurogenesis is accelerated during the elevation of hippocampal neural activities under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. One of these conditions  middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)  induces both the hyperactivities of hippocampal network and the elevation of neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation. However  the causal relationship between the elevated activity and the elevation of NSC proliferation is still unclear. In this study  to block the elevation of hippocampal activity after MCAO in mice  we utilized a typical <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA ) receptor active modulator  diazepam. With MCAO mice treated with diazepam  we observed complete disappearance of the elevation of hippocampal activity. Additionally  the diazepam treatment blocked the elevation of NSC proliferation after MCAO. From this result  it is speculated that the increased NSC proliferation is blocked by the suppression of elevated neural activity. However  diazepam might have effects other than the suppression of hippocampal activity  so we performed additional experiment and found that diazepam did not affect the number of bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells under the normal condition  whereas the GABA agonist pentobarbital stimulated NSC/neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Next  we evaluated the expression of the diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) protein and found that the cells expressed DBI in soma and on the surface of cell membrane. From these observations  we can propose that diazepam blocks the elevation of hippocampal activity and also NSC proliferation after MCAO."

Diazepam-induced sleep was used for the evaluation of the sedative properties. The macerated extract of G. dalenii protected 100 and 83.3% of mice against PTZ- and MES-induced seizures  respectively. The aqueous extract of G. dalenii protected 100 and 83.3% of mice against PTZ- and MES-induced seizures  respectively. The lyophilized extract of G. dalenii also protected 100 and 83.3% of mice against PTZ- and MES-induced seizures  respectively. The coadministration of G. dalenii with diazepam resulted in an additive effect  while the coadministration of G. dalenii with flumazenil or FG7142 resulted in antagonistic effects. The macerate of G. dalenii also exerted sedative activity by reducing the latency time to sleep and increasing the total duration of sleep induced by diazepam. The sleeping time increased from 16±3min in the control group to 118±11min at a dose of 150mg/kg of G. dalenii. The effects of G. dalenii suggested the presence of anticonvulsant and sedative activities that might show efficacy against secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures and primary generalized seizures and insomnia in humans."

Using a novel CA VII (Car7) knockout (KO) mouse as well as a CA II (Car2) KO and a CA II/VII double KO  we show that mature hippocampal pyramidal neurons are endowed with two cytosolic isoforms. CA VII is predominantly expressed by neurons starting around postnatal day 10 (P10). The ubiquitous isoform II is expressed in neurons at P20. Both isoforms enhance bicarbonate-driven GABAergic excitation during intense GABAA-receptor activation. P13-14 CA VII KO mice show behavioural manifestations atypical of experimental febrile seizures (eFS) and a complete absence of electrographic seizures. A low dose of diazepam promotes eFS in P13-P14 rat pups  whereas seizures are blocked at higher concentrations that suppress breathing. Thus  the respiratory alkalosis-dependent eFS are exacerbated by GABAergic excitation. We found that CA VII mRNA is expressed in the human cerebral cortex before the age when febrile seizures (FS) occur in children. Our data indicate that CA VII is a key molecule in age-dependent neuronal pH regulation with consequent effects on generation of FS."

Here  we combined functional and molecular techniques to analyze properties of GABA(A) receptors in NG2 cells of the juvenile mouse hippocampus. GABA activated slowly desensitizing responses in NG2 cells  which were mimicked by muscimol and inhibited by bicuculline. To elucidate the subunit composition of the receptors we tested its pharmacological properties. Coapplication of pentobarbital  benzodiazepines  and zolpidem all significantly increased the GABA-evoked responses. The presence of small tonic currents indicated the presence of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. To further analyze the subunit expression  single cell transcript analysis was performed subsequent to functional characterization of NG2 cells. The subunits a1  a2  ß3  <U+03B3>1  and <U+03B3>2 were most abundantly expressed  matching properties resulting from pharmacological characterization. Importantly  lack of the <U+03B3>2-subunit conferred a high Zn²<U+207A> sensitivity to the GABA(A) receptors of NG2 cells. Judging from the zolpidem sensitivity  postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors in NG2 cells contain the <U+03B3>2-subunit  in contrast to extrasynaptic receptors  which were not modulated by zolpidem. To determine the effect of GABA(A) receptor activation on membrane potential  perforated patch recordings were obtained from NG2 cells. In the current-clamp mode  GABA depolarized the cells to approximately -30 mV  indicating a higher intracellular Cl<U+207B> concentration (~50 mM) than previously reported.

The receptors targeted by these drugs in histaminergic neurons are unknown. TMN neurons express nine different subunits of the GABAA receptor (GABAA R) with three a- (a1  a2 and a5) and two <U+03B3>- (<U+03B3>1  <U+03B3> 2) subunits  which confer different pharmacologies of the benzodiazepine-binding site.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We investigated the actions of zolpidem  midazolam  diazepam  chlordiazepoxide  flumazenil (Ro15-1788) and methyl-6 7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-ß-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) in TMN neurons using mouse genetics  electrophysiological and molecular biological methods.KEY RESULTS: We find the sensitivity of GABAA R to zolpidem  midazolam and DMCM significantly reduced in TMN neurons from <U+03B3>2F77I mice  but modulatory activities of diazepam  chlordiazepoxide and flumazenil not affected.

Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) protein is a BZ site ligand expressed endogenously in the brain  but functional evidence for BZ-mimicking positive modulatory actions has been elusive. We demonstrate an endogenous potentiation of GABAergic synaptic transmission and responses to GABA uncaging in the thalamic reticular nucleus (nRT) that is absent in both nm1054 mice  in which the Dbi gene is deleted  and mice in which BZ binding to a3 subunit-containing GABAARs is disrupted. Viral transduction of DBI into nRT is sufficient to rescue the endogenous potentiation of GABAergic transmission in nm1054 mice. Both mutations enhance thalamocortical spike-and-wave discharges characteristic of absence epilepsy. Together  these results indicate that DBI mediates endogenous nucleus-specific BZ-mimicking (&quot;endozepine&quot;) roles to modulate nRT function and suppress thalamocortical oscillations. Enhanced DBI signaling might serve as a therapy for epilepsy and other neurological disorders."

Astrocyte swelling is a crucial event and in cultured astrocytes HE-relevant factors almost instantaneously induce the formation of RNOS. However  short term effects of ammonia  inflammatory cytokines and RNOS on the volume of astrocytes and other brain cells as well as the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown  although a pathogenic link between RNOS formation and swelling in HE has been proposed. This issue was addressed in the present study by means of live-cell volume microscopy of brain cells in vitro. Ammonia  diazepam and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor-necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)  interferon-<U+03B3>  interleukin-1ß induced within 20min astrocyte swelling by about 25% accompanied by nuclear swelling of similar magnitude. Astrocyte swelling in response to NH4Cl  TNF-a or diazepam was abolished by the antioxidant epigallocatechin-gallate pointing to an involvement of RNOS. NH4Cl-induced astrocyte swelling was sensitive to inhibition of glutamine synthetase  NADPH oxidase or nitric oxide synthases. In line with a NMDA receptor-  prostanoid- and Ca(2+)-dependence of NH4Cl-induced RNOS formation  Ca(2+) chelation and inhibition of NMDA receptors or cyclooxygenase suppressed NH4Cl-induced astrocyte swelling  whereas the Ca(2+)-ionophore ionomycin  NMDA  glutamate and prostanoids induced rapid astrocyte swelling. NH4Cl also induced swelling of cultured microglia in a glutamine-synthesis dependent way  but had no effect on cell volume of cultured neurons. It is concluded that the pathways which trigger RNOS formation in astrocytes also trigger astrocyte swelling  whereas conversely and as shown previously hypoosmotic astrocyte swelling can induce RNOS formation. This establishes a complex interplay with an auto-amplificatory loop between RNOS formation and astrocyte swelling as an important event in the pathogenesis of HE."

The identification of genetic predictors for anxiety disorders  and especially for benzodiazepine use disorder  could aid the selection of the best treatment option and improve clinical outcomes.

Deletion of Baiap3 in mice leads to enhanced seizure propensity and increased anxiety  with the latter being more pronounced in female than in male animals. We hypothesized that genetic variation in human BAIAP3 may also be associated with anxiety. By using a phenotype-based genetic association study  we identified two human BAIAP3 single-nucleotide polymorphism risk genotypes (AA for rs2235632  TT for rs1132358) that show a significant association with anxiety in women and  surprisingly  with benzodiazepine abuse in men. Returning to mice  we found that male  but not female  Baiap3 knockout (KO) mice develop tolerance to diazepam more quickly than control animals. Analysis of cultured Baiap3 KO hypothalamus slices revealed an increase in basal network activity and an altered response to diazepam withdrawal. Thus  Baiap3/BAIAP3 is gender specifically associated with anxiety and benzodiazepine use disorder  and the analysis of Baiap3/BAIAP3-related functions may help elucidate mechanisms underlying the development of both disorders."

Intraperitonial administration of pilocarpine (85 mg/kg) induced seizure in mice was assessed by behavior observations  which is significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced by TTME (100 and 200 mg/kg; i.p) in a dose dependant manner  similar to diazepam. Seizure was accompanied by significant increase in lipid peroxidation and the hippocampal nitrite content in pilocarpine group when compared with control. Moreover  the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase  catalase and glutathione levels were decreased in pilocarpine administered groups. TTME administration attenuated oxidative damage as evident by decreased lipid oxidative damage and nitrite-nitrate content and restored the level of enzymatic antioxidant defenses in hippocampus. Involvement of free radicals during epilepsy is further confirmed by histopathological analysis which showed the loss of neuronal cells in hippocampus CA1 and CA3 pyramidal region. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that TTME has anticonvulsant activity accompanied with the strong antioxidant potential plays a crucial role in reducing the oxidative stress produced by seizure."
"160","23663139","A comprehensive behavioral evaluation in the lithium-pilocarpine model in rats: effects of carisbamate administration during status epilepticus.","PURPOSE: Administration of carisbamate during status epilepticus (SE) prevents the occurrence of motor seizures in the lithium-pilocarpine model and leads in a subpopulation of rats to spike-and-wave discharges characteristic of absence epilepsy. Widespread neuroprotection accompanied this change in seizure expression. To assess whether these carisbamate-induced changes affected comorbidity  we used a large battery of behavioral tests in rats that had developed temporal lobe or absence-like seizures.METHODS: Lithium-pilocarpine or saline was administered to 60 adult rats. Carisbamate (90 mg/kg) or diazepam and saline was given 1 h after SE onset  and repeated 8 h later and twice daily over 6 more days. Rats were video-monitored for 2 months. Subsequently  locomotor activity  anxiety  and various types of memory were assessed.KEY FINDINGS: In rats with motor seizures  treated or not with carisbamate  all features of behavior were impaired compared to controls. Rats exhibiting absence-like seizures after carisbamate treatment behaved as controls in all paradigms tested along with widespread neuroprotection.SIGNIFICANCE: Carisbamate treatment leading to absence-like instead of temporal lobe seizures impressively prevented behavioral comorbidities reported by patients with epilepsy as the most disabling."
"161","23639432","A benzodiazepine impairs the neurogenic and behavioural effects of fluoxetine in a rodent model of chronic stress.","Antidepressant agents such as fluoxetine have been shown to produce neurogenic effects involving transcriptional and translational changes that direct molecular and cellular plasticity. These cellular and molecular events appear necessary to mediate the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine and may be generated through the ability for fluoxetine to regulate BDNF levels. Clinically  benzodiazepines are frequently used in combination with standard antidepressants both for initial treatment and maintenance therapy  especially when comorbid anxiety is present. However  very little is known regarding the consequence of combined treatment of benzodiazepines and antidepressant on the development of clinical effect. The current study therefore examined the effect of co-administration of fluoxetine and the benzodiazepine  diazepam  on hippocampal neurogenesis in the social isolation rodent model of chronic stress. We demonstrate that 9 weeks of social isolation induces a deficit in motivational behaviour with increased anxiety as well as impairment in hippocampal neurogenesis. This was parallelled by reduced BDNF levels in the hippocampus. While treatment with fluoxetine alone for 3 weeks restored anxiety behaviour as well as progenitor cell proliferation and the generation of new hippocampal neurons  this effect was prevented by co-administration with diazepam. This suggests that co-administering benzodiazepines with antidepressants could significantly delay or prevent the cellular and behavioural improvement needed by patients. These findings indicate the need for future clinical studies designed to investigate the combined effects of benzodiazepines and antidepressants in patients."

The mechanism could be attributed to the declined inhibitory action of GABA; therefore  alternative medications acting on other targets are necessary. The aim of the present study was to examine whether DEX  a highly specific central a2-adrenoreceptor agonist  could show the anticonvulsant effect on self-sustaining SE (SSSE)  and to explore the involved mechanisms. Five minutes after SSSE  which was induced in adult Wistar rats by constant amygdala stimulation for 25 min  DEX was injected intraperitoneally at two dosages (50/100 µg/kg). The number and cumulative time of repeated seizures were recorded; the levels of Glu/GABA and glutathione/malondialdehyde (GSH/MDA) in hippocampus tissue were detected. The results showed that DEX effectively decreased the number and cumulative time of repeated seizures  alleviated the levels of Glu and GSH/MDA in hippocampus tissue  but no effect was detected on the level of GABA  suggesting that DEX could be a potential agent for the treatment of SSSE  the possible mechanisms were antioxidation and inhibition of the Glu release."

Diazepam was used as reference anticonvulsant drugs for comparison.RESULTS: Isolated lobeline (10  20 and 30 mg/kg  i.p.) significantly delayed and antagonized (P &lt; 0.050-0.001) the onset of PTZ-induced seizures. It also antagonized strychnine induced seizures. The mortality was also prevented in the test group of animals. In biochemical evaluation  isolated lobeline (5  10 and 20 mg/kg  i.p.) significantly increased the brain GABA level. And at dose of 30 mg/kg GABA level showed slight decrease in PTZ model.CONCLUSIONS: In our findings  isolated lobeline (20mg/kg) exhibited potent anticonvulsant activity against PTZ induced seizures. Also a biochemical evaluation suggested significant increase in barain GABA level at 20 mg/kg i.p. of isolated lobeline. Hence  we may propose that lobeline reduces epileptic seizures by enhancing the GABA release supporting the GABAergic mechanism."

In an effort to develop better tolerated medicines  we have identified dual orexin 1 and 2 receptor antagonists (DORAs)  which promote sleep in preclinical animal models and humans. We compare the effects of orally administered eszopiclone  zolpidem  and diazepam to the dual orexin receptor antagonist DORA-22 on sleep and the novel object recognition test in rat  and on sleep and two cognition tests (delayed match to sample and serial choice reaction time) in the rhesus monkey. Each compound's minimal dose that promoted sleep versus the minimal dose that exerted deficits in these cognitive tests was determined  and a therapeutic margin was established. We found that DORA-22 has a wider therapeutic margin for sleep versus cognitive impairment in rat and rhesus monkey compared to the other compounds tested. These data were further supported with the demonstration of a wider therapeutic margin for DORA-22 compared to the other compounds on sleep versus the expression of hippocampal activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc)  an immediate-early gene product involved in synaptic plasticity. These findings suggest that DORAs might provide an effective treatment for insomnia with a greater therapeutic margin for sleep versus cognitive disturbances compared to the GABAA-positive allosteric modulators currently in use."

Additionally  the effect of 5% lavender essential oil was also evaluated in mice subjected to the elevated plus maze. GABAA/benzodiazepine mediation was evaluated by pretreating the mice with the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin before the marble burying test and [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor. Serotonergic mediation was studied by pretreating the mice with O-methyl-[3H]-N-(2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY100635)  a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist before the marble burying test. We also evaluated changes in the pharmacologically induced serotonin syndrome and the effects of combined administration of subeffective doses of lavender essential oil and the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT).RESULTS: Lavender essential oil (1-5%) decreased the number of marbles buried compared with the control and amyl acetate groups. In the elevated plus maze  5% lavender essential oil inhalation increased the percentage of time spent on and number of entries into the open arms compared with controls. No effect was seen in the number of closed arm entries or number of beam interruptions in the automated activity chamber. Pretreatment with the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin (0.5mg/kg) did not modify the behavioral effect of 5% lavender essential oil in the marble-burying test. Lavender essential oil also did not alter [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor. Pretreatment with the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (3mg/kg) blocked the anxiolytic-like effect of lavender essential oil and the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (3mg/kg). A combination of ineffective doses of 8-OH-DPAT (0.5mg/kg) and lavender essential oil (0.1%) reduced the number of marbles buried. Finally  5% lavender essential oil attenuated the serotonin syndrome induced by 40 mg/kg fluoxetine plus 80 mg/kg 5-hydroxytryptophan.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate an important role for the serotonergic system in the anxiolytic-like effect of lavender essential oil."
"166","23519373","Diazepam inhibits proliferation of human glioblastoma cells through triggering a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.","BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM)  the most common primary brain tumor  is the most aggressive malignancy in humans. Its rapid proliferation is a major obstacle to successful treatment. Patients with GBM often suffer from psychological disturbances associated with poor prognosis and physical discomfort. Diazepam is one of the most frequently used benzodiazepines (BZs) in cancer patients for its desirable psychotropic effects. The central effects of BZs are mediated by the activation of central BZ receptors. This study investigates whether diazepam has inhibitory effect on proliferation of GBM cell line T98G and explores its possible mechanism.METHODS: Cell viability and proliferation were respectively determined by 3-(4 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. Cell cycle distribution was examined by flow cytometry. Western blot with specific protein antibodies was used to detect regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle regulation.RESULTS: Diazepam significantly decreased the proliferation of T98G cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. This effect was not reversed by the central BZ receptor antagonist flumazenil or the peripheral BZ receptor antagonist PK11195  indicating that it was not mediated by BZ receptors. Flow cytometry indicated that diazepam caused a cell accumulation in G0/G1 phase  thereby contributing to cell proliferation inhibition. Furthermore  our findings showed that lessened phosphorylation of Rb accounted for diazepam-induced G0/G1 phase arrest.CONCLUSIONS: Diazepam inhibits the proliferation of human GBM T98G cells by inducing G0/G1 phase arrest. Diazepam has potential to be a lead for new drugs in GBM therapy because of its antitumor activity."

We aimed to further characterize the B(0)AT2 transporter in CNS  and to use Slc6a15 knock out (KO) mice to investigate whether B(0)AT2 is important for mediating the anorexigenic effect of leucine. We used the Slc6a15 KO mice to investigate the role of B(0)AT2 in brain in response to leucine and in particular the effect on food intake. Slc6a15 KO mice show lower reduction of food intake as well as lower neuronal activation in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) in response to leucine injections compared to wild type mice. We also used RT-PCR on rat tissues  in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry on mouse CNS tissues to document in detail the distribution of SLC6A15 on gene and protein levels. We showed that B(0)AT2 immunoreactivity is mainly neuronal  including localization in many GABAergic neurons and spinal cord motor neurons. B(0)AT2 immunoreactivity was also found in astrocytes close to ventricles  and co-localized with cytokeratin and diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. The data suggest that B(0)AT2 play a role in leucine homeostasis in the brain."

However  no studies have yet assessed the defensive behaviour repertoire of animals in this modified test. In Experiment 1  factor analysis was employed to characterise the behavioural profile of mice exposed to the oEPM. Experiments 2 and 3 assessed the effects of acute alprazolam (0.5-1.5mg/kg; diazepam 0.5-1.5mg/kg)  pentylenetetrazole (10.0-30.0mg/kg)  yohimbine (2.0-6.0mg/kg)  mCPP (0.3-3.0mg/kg)  and acute and chronic fluoxetine (10.0-30.0mg/kg) and imipramine (1.0-15.0mg/kg) on behaviours identified in Experiment 1. The factor analyses revealed that behaviour in the oEPM can largely (77% total variance) be accounted for in terms of 3 factors: factor 1 ('depth exploration'; e.g. head-dipping on the arms)  factor 2 ('cautious exploration of arms'; e.g. flatback approach)  and factor 3 ('risk assessment'; stretched attend postures - SAP). Experiments 2 and 3 showed that  over the dose range used  alprazolam selectively attenuated all measures of defensiveness. Similar  though more modest  effects were seen with diazepam. Confirming the intensity of the emotional response to the oEPM (nociceptive  endocrine and behavioural)  relatively few significant behavioural changes were seen in response to the anxiogenic compounds tested. Although acute fluoxetine or imipramine treatment failed to modify behaviour in the oEPM  chronic fluoxetine (but not chronic imipramine) attenuated total flat back approach and increased head dipping outside the central square. Together  the results indicate that the oEPM induces behavioural defensive responses that are sensitive to alprazolam and chronic fluoxetine."

During the rewarming period after deep cooling  most Wistar rats suffered from bilaterally synchronous spike and waves with no or mild behavioral correlates. Spike and wave seizures were temperature-dependent and were initially registered when body temperature (Tb) reached 25-27°C  but mostly during the mild hypothermia of 0.3-1.3°C (Tb of 36.3-37.3°C). In chemical absence models  spike and wave discharges were also closely accompanied by mild systemic hypothermia  as both PTZ- and GHB-induced temperature decreases ranged from about 1-1.4°C respectively  together with EEG markers of absence activity. Thus  throughout the different experimental designs  the occurrence of spike and wave discharges was always related to a mild (0.3-1.4°C) decrease of Tb. Benzodiazepine diazepam as the GABAA-positive allosteric modulator and CGP 62349 as the selective antagonist of GABAB receptors were used to determine if their well-known anticonvulsant properties also affect hypothermia elicited by these drugs. Finally  during the course of spontaneous rewarming from deep hypothermia  another selective GABAB-blocking agent  CGP 35348  was used to elucidate if GABAB inhibitory system could be critically implicated in the generation of hypothermia-dependent spike and waves. Diazepam prevented both the PTZ-induced hypothermia and electrographic absence seizures  but these two beneficial effects did not occur in the GHB model. Even though diazepam delayed GHB-induced maximal temperature decrease  the GHB effects remained highly significant. The GABAB antagonist CGP 62349 completely prevented hypothermia as well as absence seizures in both chemical models. Likewise  spike and wave discharges  registered during the spontaneous rewarming from deep hypothermia  were completely prevented by CGP 35348. These findings show that systemic hypothermia should definitely be regarded as a marker of GABAB receptor activation. Moreover  the results of this study clearly show that initial mild temperature decrease should be considered as strong absence-provoking factor. Hypothermia-induced nonconvulsive seizures also highlight the importance of continuous EEG monitoring in children undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. Since every change in peripheral or systemic temperature ultimately must be perceived by preoptic region of the anterior hypothalamus as the primary thermoregulatory and sleep-inducing center  the preoptic thermosensitive neurons in general and warm-sensitive neurons in particular  simply have to be regarded as the most probable candidate for connected thermoregulatory and absence generating mechanisms. Therefore  additional studies are needed to confirm their potential role in the generation and propagation of absence seizures."

However  the cellular mechanisms underlying benzodiazepine dependence have not been fully clarified. Several investigators have shown an involvement of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the pathophysiology of dependence or withdrawal. This study was performed to elucidate the role of mGluRs in benzodiazepine dependence. Withdrawal signs were precipitated in mice by flumazenil injection (25 mg/kg) after continuous subcutaneous infusion of benzodiazepines for 7 days  and the effects of several Gi-coupled receptor ligands on forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation were examined in the cerebral cortex of mice. The mRNA expression for mGluRs was determined by RT-PCR. A single injection of flumazenil precipitated typical withdrawal signs such as tail elevation and tremor in mice treated with diazepam or alprazolam  but not quazepam. The inhibitory effect of nonselective mGluR ligands on adenylate cyclase activity was diminished in mice that showed signs of benzodiazepine withdrawal. The mRNA expression levels of mGluR2 and mGluR3 were lowered in the cerebral cortex of mice pretreated with diazepam or alprazolam. Our findings suggest that the reduction in the expression of group II mGluRs subunits may be involved in the development of benzodiazepine dependence."

Appropriate models in vitro often fail to represent in vivo physiology. To address these issues we propose the use of a novel artificial vascular system that closely mimics capillary and venous segments of human cerebrovasculature while also allowing for an extensive control of the experimental variables and their manipulation.RESULTS: Using hollow fiber technology  we modified an existing dynamic artificial model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (DIV-capillary) to encompass the distal post-capillary (DIV-venules) segments of the brain circulatory system. This artificial brain vascular system is comprised of a BBB module serially connected to a venule segment. A pump generates a pulsatile flow with arterial pressure feeding the system. The perfusate of the capillary module achieves levels of shear stress  pressure  and flow rate comparable to what observed in situ. Endothelial cell exposure to flow and abluminal astrocytic stimuli allowed for the formation of a highly selective capillary BBB with a trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER; &gt;700 ohm cm2) and sucrose permeability (&lt; 1X10-u cm/sec) comparable to in vivo. The venule module  which attempted to reproduce features of the hemodynamic microenvironment of venules  was perfused by media resulting in shear stress and intraluminal pressure levels lower than those found in capillaries. Because of altered cellular and hemodynamic factors  venule segments present a less stringent vascular bed (TEER &lt;250 Ohm cm2; Psucrose &gt; 1X10-4 cm/sec) than that of the BBB. Abluminal human brain vascular smooth muscle cells were used to reproduce the venular abluminal cell composition.CONCLUSION: The unique characteristics afforded by the DIV-BBB in combination with a venule segment will realistically expand our ability to dissect and study the physiological and functional behavior of distinct segments of the human cerebrovascular network."

Although there are few controlled studies that support the long-term use of EGb for the prevention and/or treatment of memory impairment  the chronic use of Ginkgo is common. This study evaluated the effects of chronic treatment with EGb on the conditioned emotional response  assessed by the suppression of ongoing behavior and in the modulation of gene and protein expression. Male adult Wistar rats were treated over 28days and assigned to five groups (n=10) as follows: positive control (4mgkg(-1) Diazepam)  negative control (12% Tween 80)  EGb groups (0.5 and 1.0gkg(-1)) and the naïve group. The suppression of the licking response was calculated for each rat in six trials. Our results provide further evidence for the efficacy of EGb on memory. For the first time  we show that long-term treatment with the highest dose of EGb improves the fear memory and suggests that increased cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA and protein (P&lt;0.001) in the dorsal hippocampus and amygdaloid complex and reduced growth and plasticity-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) (P&lt;0.01) in the hippocampus are involved in this process.

Cerebellar granule cells were exposed to penitrem A  alone or together with different pharmacological agents  before cell survival was assessed with the MTT assay or formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was investigated with the DCF assay. Penitrem A caused a time- and concentration-dependent reduction in cell survival  as well as a concentration-dependent increase in ROS production. Co-incubation with diazepam  GABA  BAPTA-AM  vitamin E  SP600125 and cyclosporine A significantly reduced cell death. Our results show that penitrem A is toxic to cerebellar granule neurons in vitro. Further  ROS production and the GABAA receptor are likely to be involved in the induction of neuronal death following penitrem A exposure. A disruption of calcium homeostasis and activation of the JNK pathway may also play a role in penitrem A neurotoxicity."

Pilocarpine (350mg/kg  i.p.) was administered 30min after piperine (2.5  5  10 and 20mg/kg  i.p.) which significantly increased latencies to 1st convulsion and to death  and percentage of survivals. These parameters were also increased in the pilocarpine groups pretreated with atropine plus piperine (10 and 2.5mg/kg  respectively)  as related to the pilocarpine group. However  they were not altered in the pilocarpine groups pretreated with memantine (a NMDA-type glutamate receptors blocker  2mg/kg  p.o.) or nimodipine (a calcium channel blocker  10mg/kg  p.o.)  both associated with piperine (1 or 2.5mg/kg)  as compared to the piperine plus pilocarpine group. Moreover  the pilocarpine group pretreated with diazepam (which binds to the GABAA receptor  0.2 and 0.5mg/kg  i.p.) plus piperine (1 and 2.5mg/kg) significantly increased latency to the 1st convulsion  as related to the pilocarpine group  suggesting that the GABAergic system is involved with the piperine action. Furthermore  the piperine effect was blocked by flumazenil (2mg/kg  i.p.)  a benzodiazepine antagonist. Untreated P350 animals showed decreased striatal DA and increased DOPAC and HVA levels that were not affected in the piperine plus pilocarpine groups. Piperine increased striatal levels of GABA  glycine and taurine  and reversed pilocarpine-induced increases in nitrite contents in sera and brain. Hippocampi from the untreated pilocarpine group showed an increased number of TNF-a immunostained cells in all areas  as opposed to the pilocarpine group pretreated with piperine. Taken together  piperine anticonvulsant effects are the result of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions  as well as TNF-a reduction. In addition  piperine effects on inhibitory amino acids and on the GABAergic system may certainly contribute to the drug anticonvulsant activity."

Because of its extensive connections and involvement in many higher-order cognitive functions  neurodegenerative changes in the parietal lobe are believed to be crucial in the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Little is known about the transcriptome of this part of the human brain or how it is perturbed by the neurodegenerative process. To that end  we performed mRNA sequencing using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique on samples derived from normal and AD parietal lobes. Gene expression analysis evaluating alternatively spliced isoform expression and promoter usage revealed surprisingly elevated transcriptome activity in the AD condition. This phenomenon was particularly apparent in the alternative usage of transcriptional start sites. A Gene Ontology analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed enrichment in the functional pathways related to lipid metabolism  thus highlighting the importance of astrocyte activity in the neurodegenerative process. We also identified an upregulation of the diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) gene in AD  as the result of a splicing switch toward shorter  intron-retaining isoforms driven by alternative promoters and was coupled with a simultaneous decrease in the abundance of protein-coding transcripts. These two DBI isoforms have not been described previously."

In this study  we have investigated the potential neuroprotective effect of the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons (CGN). ODN  which is produced by astrocytes  is an endogenous ligand for both central-type benzodiazepine receptors (CBR) and a metabotropic receptor. Incubation of neurons with subnanomolar concentrations of ODN (10<U+207B>¹8 to 10<U+207B>¹² M) inhibited 6-OHDA-evoked cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of ODN on neuronal survival was abrogated by the metabotropic receptor antagonist  cyclo1<U+208B>8 [DLeu5]OP  but not by a CBR antagonist. ODN stimulated polyphosphoinositide turnover and ERK phosphorylation in CGN. The protective effect of ODN against 6-OHDA toxicity involved the phospholipase C/ERK MAPK transduction cascade. 6-OHDA treatment induced an accumulation of reactive oxygen species  an increase of the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax  a drop of the mitochondrial membrane potential and a stimulation of caspase-3 activity. Exposure of 6-OHDA-treated cells to ODN blocked all the deleterious effects of the toxin. Taken together  these data demonstrate for the first time that ODN is a neuroprotective agent that prevents 6-OHDA-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death."

Simvastatin only was active against both the tonic and clonic phase of audiogenic seizures  whereas the other statins tested were only partially effective against the tonic phase with the following order of potency: lovastatin&gt;fluvastatin&gt;atorvastatin; pravastatin was completely ineffective up to the dose of 150mg/kg. The co-administration of ineffective doses of all statins with AEDs generally increased the potency of the latter reducing their ED50 values. In particular  simvastatin was the most active in potentiating the activity of AEDs and the combinations of statins with carbamazepine  diazepam  felbamate  lamotrigine  topiramate and valproate were the most favorable  whereas  the co-administrations with the other AEDs studied was in most cases neutral. The increase in potency was generally associated with an enhancement of motor impairment (TD50); however  the therapeutic index (TD50/ED50) of combined treatment of AEDs with statins was predominantly more favorable than control. Statins administration did not significantly affect the total plasma but  in some cases  it increased the free plasma levels and the brain concentrations of some of the AEDs studied (i.e. carbamazepine  diazepam  phenytoin and valproate); however  these alterations where not statistically significant. Therefore  with the exception of the latter compounds  we might exclude pharmacokinetic interactions and conclude that for the most of AEDs  potentiation was of pharmacodynamic nature. In conclusion  simvastatin  fluvastatin  lovastatin and atorvastatin showed an additive anticonvulsant effect when co-administered with some AEDs  most notably carbamazepine  diazepam  felbamate  lamotrigine  topiramate and valproate  implicating a possible therapeutic relevance of such drug combinations. The present results suggest that statins  besides the beneficial cardiovascular effects  might be able to affect brain areas  which might participate in the regulation of seizure susceptibility."

In this study  we investigated the functional significance of the membrane distribution of NMDA and GABAA receptor subunits in relation to the accumulation of the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (DMI) and the benzodiazepine diazepam (Diaz). In the presence of Triton X-100  which allowed proper separation of the lipid raft marker proteins caveolin-1 and flotillin-1 from the transferrin receptor  all receptor subunits were shifted to the non-raft fractions. In contrast  under detergent-free conditions  NMDA and GABAA receptor subunits were detected both in raft and non-raft fractions. Diaz was enriched in non-raft fractions without Triton X-100 in contrast to DMI  which preferentially accumulated in lipid rafts. Impairment of lipid raft integrity by methyl-ß-cyclodextrine (MßCD)-induced cholesterol depletion did not change the inhibitory effect of DMI at the NMDA receptor  whereas it enhanced the potentiating effect of Diaz at the GABAA receptor at non-saturating concentrations of GABA. These results support the hypothesis that the interaction of benzodiazepines with the GABAA receptor likely occurs outside of lipid rafts while the antidepressant DMI acts on ionotropic receptors both within and outside these membrane microdomains."

New formulations in clinical development  such as intranasal midazolam  diazepam auto-injection  a new formulation of valproic acid using drug targeting technology and controlled release formulations for topiramate and pregabalin  are also discussed.EXPERT OPINION: During the last 30 years  antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) development have been based on specific assumptions regarding the neurobiology of epilepsy but all marketed drugs have not changed the proportion of drug refractory patients. AEDs in development with new mechanisms of actions  especially anti-inflammatory agents  are of interest. AMPA blockers  especially water-soluble ones  being suitable for parenteral formulation  can be of relevance in treating refractory status epilepticus  a major life-threatening complication. Finally  new formulations  especially those adopting drug targeting technologies are promising in order to maximize the efficacy with very limited adverse effects."

Here we examined the functional properties of the GABA(A) receptors that are spared following ischemia in cultured Purkinje cells from rat and in vivo ischemia in mouse. Using subunit-specific positive modulators of GABA(A) receptors  we observed that oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and cardiac arrest-induced cerebral ischemia cause a decrease in sensitivity to the ß(2/3) -subunit-preferring compound  etomidate. However  sensitivity to propofol  a ß-subunit-acting compound that modulates ß(1-3) -subunits  was not affected by OGD. The a/<U+03B3>-subunit-acting compounds  diazepam and zolpidem  were also unaffected by OGD. We performed single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on isolated PCs from acutely dissociated cerebellar tissue and observed that PCs expressed the ß(1) -subunit  contrary to previous reports examining GABA(A) receptor subunit expression in PCs. GABA(A) receptor ß(1) -subunit protein was also detected in cultured PCs by western blot and by immunohistochemistry in the adult mouse cerebellum and levels remained unaffected by ischemia. High concentrations of loreclezole (30 µm) inhibited PC GABA-mediated currents  as previously demonstrated with ß(1) -subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors expressed in heterologous systems. From our data we conclude that PCs express the ß(1) -subunit and that there is a greater contribution of ß(1) -subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors following OGD."
"182","23175811","Enhanced GABAergic activity in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex is insufficient to alleviate chronic pain behavior with reduced expression of neuronal potassium-chloride cotransporter.","The correct balance between excitation and inhibition is crucial for brain function and disrupted in several pathological conditions. Excitatory neuronal circuits in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) are modulated by local inhibitory neurons with the balance of this excitatory and inhibitory activity important for function. The activity of excitatory layer 2/3 neurons (L2/3) in the S1 cortex is increased in chronic pain  but it is not known how the local interneurons  nor the balance between excitation and inhibition  may change in chronic pain. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology  we report here that the response of L2/3 local inhibitory neurons to both sensory stimulation and to layer 4 electrical stimulation increases in inflammatory chronic pain. Local application into L2/3 of a GABA(A) receptor blocker further enhanced the activity of S1 excitatory neurons and reduced pain thresholds  whereas local application of the GABA(A) receptor modulators (muscimol and diazepam) transiently alleviated the allodynia. This illustrates the importance of the local inhibitory pathways in chronic pain sensation. A reduction in the expression and function of the potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 occurred during chronic pain  which reduces the efficacy of the inhibitory inputs to L2/3 excitatory neurons. In summary  both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activities in the S1 are enhanced in the chronic pain model  but the increased inhibition is insufficient to completely counterbalance the increased excitation and alleviate the symptoms of chronic pain."
"183","23160530","Gliotransmission and brain glucose sensing: critical role of endozepines.","Hypothalamic glucose sensing is involved in the control of feeding behavior and peripheral glucose homeostasis  and glial cells are suggested to play an important role in this process. Diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) and its processing product the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN)  collectively named endozepines  are secreted by astroglia  and ODN is a potent anorexigenic factor. Therefore  we investigated the involvement of endozepines in brain glucose sensing. First  we showed that intracerebroventricular administration of glucose in rats increases DBI expression in hypothalamic glial-like tanycytes. We then demonstrated that glucose stimulates endozepine secretion from hypothalamic explants. Feeding experiments indicate that the anorexigenic effect of central administration of glucose was blunted by coinjection of an ODN antagonist. Conversely  the hyperphagic response elicited by central glucoprivation was suppressed by an ODN agonist. The anorexigenic effects of centrally injected glucose or ODN agonist were suppressed by blockade of the melanocortin-3/4 receptors  suggesting that glucose sensing involves endozepinergic control of the melanocortin pathway. Finally  we found that brain endozepines modulate blood glucose levels  suggesting their involvement in a feedback loop controlling whole-body glucose homeostasis. Collectively  these data indicate that endozepines are a critical relay in brain glucose sensing and potentially new targets in treatment of metabolic disorders."

Most GABA synthesis in the brain is catalyzed in inhibitory neurons from L-glutamic acid by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67). In the current study  we sought to examine the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear in mice with knocked down expression of the GABA synthesizing enzyme GAD67 in the amygdala using a lentiviral-based (LV) RNA interference strategy to locally induce loss-of-function. In vitro experiments revealed that our LV-siRNA-GAD67 construct diminished the expression of GAD67 as determined with western blot and fluorescent immunocytochemical analyses. In vivo experiments  in which male C57BL/6J mice received bilateral amygdala microinjections  revealed that LV-siRNA-GAD67 injections produce significant inhibition of endogenous GAD67 when compared with control injections. In contrast  no significant changes in GAD65 expression were detected in the amygdala  validating the specificity of LV knockdown. Behavioral experiments showed that LV knockdown of GAD67 results in a deficit in the extinction  but not the acquisition or retention  of fear as measured by conditioned freezing. GAD67 knockdown did not affect baseline locomotion or basal measures of anxiety as measured in open field apparatus. However  diminished GAD67 in the amygdala blunted the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam (1.5 mg kg(-1)) as measured in the elevated plus maze. Together  these studies suggest that of GABAergic transmission in amygdala mediates the inhibition of conditioned fear and the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam in adult mice."

Thyroxine at micromolar concentrations potentiated the (3)H-Ro15-4513 binding to rat brain membranes in-vitro in the thalamus  striatum  cortex and hippocampus  but not in cerebellum. In the thalamus  the rank order of potency was the following: 3 3' 5 5'-tetraiodothyroacetic acid (TETRAC)&gt;L-thyroxine&gt;3 5-diiodo-l-thyronine (3 5-T2). TETRAC induced a slight potentiation of flumazenil binding to diazepam-sensitive GABA(A) receptors in the thalamus and striatum while no effect was found in cortex and hippocampus. Consequently  we examined whether these compounds could exert their modulatory effect on the currents mediated by benzodiazepine-insensitive GABA(A) receptors. The diazepam-insensitive GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents were recorded from acutely isolated rat ventrobasal thalamic neurons by applying low concentrations of 4 5 6 7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5 4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP). TETRAC and thyroxine at low µM concentrations potentiated the THIP-evoked currents  although 3 5-T2 had no effect on the THIP-induced currents. Ethanol had no effect on the enhancing effects of TETRAC. TETRAC itself evoked GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents at high concentrations beyond 30 µM. Although the effects of TETRAC and thyroxine were observed at non-physiological concentrations of hormones  the present results might lead to new lead structures with specificity to diazepam-insensitive GABA(A) receptor subtypes."

Using pimonidazole  which probes hypoxic insults  we found that by increasing the duration of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) from 30 to 120 min  counts of pimonidazole-immunoreactive neurons also increased (P &lt; 0.01  120 vs 60 and 30 min). All the animals exposed to SE were immunopositive to pimonidazole  but a different scenario emerged during epileptogenesis when a decrease in pimonidazole-immunostained cells occurred from 7 to 14 days  so that only 1 out of 4 rats presented with pimonidazole-immunopositive cells. Pimonidazole-immunoreactive cells robustly reappeared at 21 days post-SE induction when all animals (7 out of 7) had developed spontaneous recurrent seizures. Specific neuronal markers revealed that immunopositivity to pimonidazole was present in cells identified by neuropeptide Y (NPY) or somatostatin antibodies. At variance  neurons immunopositive to parvalbumin or cholecystokinin were not immunopositive to pimonidazole. Pimonidazole-immunopositive neurons expressed remarkable immunoreactivity to hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a). Interestingly  surgical samples obtained from pharmacoresistant patients showed neurons co-labeled by HIF-1a and NPY antibodies. These interneurons  along with parvalbumin-positive interneurons that were negative to HIF-1a  showed immunopositivity to markers of cell damage  such as high-mobility group box 1 in the cytoplasm and cleaved caspase-3 in the nucleus. These findings suggest that interneurons are continuously endangered in rodent and human epileptogenic tissue. The presence of hypoxia and cell damage markers in NPY interneurons of rats and patients presenting with recurrent seizures indicates a mechanism of selective vulnerability in a specific neuronal subpopulation."
"187","23071808","GABAergic control of critical developmental periods for anxiety- and depression-related behavior in mice.","Vulnerability for anxiety and depressive disorders is thought to have origins in early life and is increasingly recognized to involve deficits in GABAergic neurotransmission. Mice that were rendered heterozygous for the <U+03B3>2 subunit gene of GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) show behavioral  cognitive  neuroendocrine and pharmacologic features expected of a mouse model of melancholic anxious depression  including reduced survival of adult-born hippocampal neurons. Here we embarked on elucidating the developmental substrate underlying this phenotype  focusing on the Elevated Plus Maze and Forced Swim Test as relevant behavioral paradigms. In a first series of experiments using hemizygous tamoxifen-induced genetic inactivation of a floxed <U+03B3>2 genomic locus we show that reducing the gene dosage at postnatal days (P)13/14 but not P27/28 results in altered behavior in both of these tests in adulthood  reminiscent of the anxious-depressive phenotype previously described for global heterozygous mice. However  in contrast to global heterozygous mice  the behavioral changes induced by <U+03B3>2 subunit knockdown at P13/14 occurred without changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis  indicating that altered neurogenesis is not an absolute prerequisite for anxiety- and depression-related behavior in this model. In a separate series of experiments using a pharmacological approach  acute but transient potentiation of GABA(A)Rs with diazepam uncovered distinct developmental vulnerabilities for altered behavior in the Elevated Plus Maze and Forced Swim Test  respectively. Specifically  diazepam given during P10-16 but not during later weeks resulted in increased anxiety-like behavior in adulthood  while diazepam administered during P29-35 but not earlier nor later resulted in increased immobility behavior in adulthood. We conclude that anxiety-like behavior in the Elevated Plus Maze and behavioral despair-like immobility in the Forced Swim Test are controlled by separate postnatal critical periods characterized by distinct developmental sensitivity to manipulation of GABAergic transmission via <U+03B3>2 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs."

Here  I investigated the expression of PTZ-induced generalized clonic and tonic-clonic seizures in rats  using two potent NCX reverse mode inhibitors  KB-R7943 and SN-6 for NCX subtypes 3 (NCX3) and 1 (NCX1)  respectively. Pretreatment with KB-R7943 (3  10  and 30 mg/kg; p.o.) significantly reduced the expression of PTZ-induced generalized seizures with clonic and tonic-clonic components in 12-62% and 25-62% of the treated animals  respectively. In the remaining animals that exhibited seizures  KB-R7943 (3 mg/kg; p.o.) pretreatment significantly delayed the onset of the first seizure episode and reduced the seizure severity. Following pretreatment with SN-6 (0.3  1  3  10  and 30 mg/kg; p.o.)  clonic and tonic-clonic PTZ-induced generalized seizures were reduced in 25-50% and 38-63% of treated animals  respectively. SN-6 (0.3  1  and 3 mg/kg; p.o.) also significantly reduced PTZ-induced seizure severity scores  but did not alter seizure latencies. KB-R7943 (3 and 30 mg/kg; p.o.) or SN-6 (3 and 30 mg/kg; p.o.) administration potentiated the sub-anticonvulsant dose of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg; i.p.) that suppresses clonic and tonic-clonic PTZ-induced seizures. These findings suggested that Ca²<U+207A> influx via the NCX in reverse mode contributes to a neuronal hyperexcitability that leads to clonic and tonic-clonic generalized seizures and that the NCX1 and NCX3 isoforms may serve as novel molecular targets for seizure suppression."
"189","22963996","Possible involvement of histone acetylation in the development of emotional resistance to stress stimuli in mice.","Recent reports have implied that aberrant biochemical processes in the brain frequently accompany subtle shifts in the cellular epigenetic profile that might underlie the pathogenic progression of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore  certain antidepressants or mood stabilizers have been reported to have the ability to modulate epigenetic parameters. We previously reported that pretreatment of mice with 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists 24 h before testing suppressed the decrease in emotional behaviors induced by exposure to acute restraint stress. Based on this finding  the aim of the present study was to examine the association between the development of emotional resistance to stress stimuli and the modulation of an epigenetic parameter  particularly histone acetylation. We found that acetylated histone H3 was increased in the hippocampus of mice that had developed resistance to emotional stress by pretreatment with flesinoxan (1 mg/kg  i.p.) 24 h before testing. On the other hand  pretreatment with benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam (1 mg/kg  i.p.) did not have similar effects. Interestingly  similar to flesinoxan  the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A also protected against the emotional changes induced by acute restraint stress  as well as histone H3 acetylation. The present findings suggest that the epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation may play an important role in the development of emotional resistance to stress stimuli."
"190","22960187","Rapid epileptogenesis in the mouse pilocarpine model: video-EEG, pharmacokinetic and histopathological characterization.","Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of drug-resistant epilepsy and several rodent models allow studying the pathophysiology of this disorder. One of the best characterized models of TLE is the pilocarpine model. The model has been widely used in rats  but relatively few studies report data obtained with mice. This triggered the present study to perform a comprehensive characterization of the mouse pilocarpine model. We used male NMRI mice (28-32 g) and first established the dose-response relationship for pilocarpine (250-400 mg/kg; ip) to induce status epilepticus (SE). This enabled to define the optimal dose (300 mg/kg) producing the highest SE response (50%) associated with the best survival rate of the animals (90%). The impact of different durations of SE (0.5-3.0 h) on the time to the onset of the first spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) was recorded during 5-day continuous video monitoring following the SE. Virtually no &quot;latent&quot; period was observed as the seizures appeared already within 24-48 h after the pilocarpine-induced SE and 0.5 h duration of the SE was sufficient to trigger SRS. Pharmacokinetics assessment showed that these seizures were not associated with residual pilocarpine exposure as it was cleared from the blood and brain already within 24 h post-injection. Consistent with previous reports from the rat pilocarpine model we observed that the extent of hippocampal reorganization and neuronal loss correlates with the duration of SE. However  the shorter durations of SE (0.5-2.0 h) appeared to produce cell loss restricted mainly to the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Interestingly  we also observed that the number of seizures occurring within 5 days after SE appeared to correlate with the degree of hippocampal damage. Continuous 7-week video-EEG monitoring after the SE revealed that SRS were expressed in a particular pattern of clusters. Taken together  the current study provides an in-depth characterization of the mouse pilocarpine model and confirms several features of the epileptogenesis process previously reported from the rat pilocarpine model. However  the mouse pilocarpine model differs by the rapid onset of seizures and an apparent correlation between their numbers and the degree of histopathological changes. Our findings highlight that the pilocarpine model of TLE in mice is associated with brain pathology akin to different stages of human disease and may provide a valuable tool for the discovery of future antiepileptic drugs with disease-modifying properties."

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed a developmental stabilization of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters concomitant with an increase in cluster size and synaptic strength between 1 and 4 weeks in vitro. Prolonged treatment of the slice cultures with diazepam or a GABAA receptor antagonist disclosed a homeostatic regulation of both inhibitory synaptic strength and gephyrin cluster size and stability in 4-weeks-old cultures  whereas at 1 week in vitro  the same drug treatments modulated GABAergic postsynapse and gephyrin cluster properties following a Hebbian mode of synaptic plasticity. Our data are consistent with a model in which the postnatal maturation of the hippocampal network endows CA1 pyramidal neurons with the ability to homeostatically adjust the strength of their inhibitory postsynapses to afferent GABAergic drive by regulating gephyrin scaffold properties."

In-vivo binding studies with [(3)H]flumazenil confirmed compounds occupied CNS GABA(A) receptors.RESULTS: Chronic diazepam treatment resulted in tolerance to diazepam's acute anxiolytic  hypothermic and sedative effects. In mice treated chronically with bretazenil  tolerance to diazepam's anxiolytic and hypothermic  but not sedative  effects was seen. Chronic zolpidem treatment resulted in tolerance to diazepam's hypothermic effect  but partial anxiolytic tolerance and no sedative tolerance. Chronic TPA023 treatment did not result in tolerance to diazepam's hypothermic  anxiolytic or sedative effects.CONCLUSIONS: OUR DATA INDICATE THAT: (i) GABA(A)-a(2)/a(3) subtype selective drugs might not induce tolerance; (ii) in rodents quantitative and temporal variations in tolerance development occur dependent on the endpoint assessed  consistent with clinical experience with benzodiazepines (e.g.  differential tolerance to antiepileptic and anxiolytic actions); (iii) tolerance to diazepam's sedative actions needs concomitant activation of GABA(A)-a(1)/GABA(A)-a(5) receptors. Regarding mechanism  in-situ hybridization studies indicated no gross changes in expression levels of GABA(A) a(1)  a(2) or a(5) subunit mRNA in hippocampus or cortex. Since selective chronic activation of either GABA(A) a(2)  or a(3) receptors does not engender tolerance development  subtype-selective GABA(A) drugs might constitute a promising class of novel drugs."

Therefore  we aimed to investigate the effects of diazepam on the progression of periodontitis in chronically stressed rats.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen Wistar rats were submitted to ligature-induced periodontal disease and were divided into four groups . Two groups were not stressed  whereas two groups were submitted to a conditioned fear stress paradigm for 38 d. Daily diazepam treatment (2 mg/kg  orally) was administered to one unstressed group and to one group submitted to a conditioned fear stress paradigm from day 2 to the day 39  at which point the rats were submitted to an open field test and were killed on day 40. Brains and mandibles were removed for histological and immunohistochemical analyses.RESULTS: Animals exposed to conditioned fear stress presented an increase in freezing behavior  a decrease in locomotor activity  enhanced alveolar bone loss and higher levels of hippocampal interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)  compared with the control group. Diazepam  at the dose used in the current study  had no effect on freezing behavior but reversed the decrease in locomotor activity provoked by stress. Additionally  the treatment reduced the levels of hippocampal IL-1ß and IL-6 and alveolar bone loss in Wistar rats. Neither conditioned fear stress nor diazepam treatment had an effect on periodontal IL-1ß or IL-6 levels in animals.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that diazepam treatment reduces bone loss in rats submitted to conditioned fear stress. In addition  diazepam treatment led to decreased IL-1ß and IL-6 levels in the hippocampus."

We characterized TETS as an activator of spontaneous Ca²<U+207A> oscillations and electrical burst discharges in mouse hippocampal neuronal cultures at 13-17 days in vitro using FLIPR Fluo-4 fluorescence measurements and extracellular microelectrode array recording. Acute exposure to TETS (= 2 µM) reversibly altered the pattern of spontaneous neuronal discharges  producing clustered burst firing and an overall increase in discharge frequency. TETS also dramatically affected Ca²<U+207A> dynamics causing an immediate but transient elevation of neuronal intracellular Ca²<U+207A> followed by decreased frequency of Ca²<U+207A> oscillations but greater peak amplitude. The effect on Ca²<U+207A> dynamics was similar to that elicited by picrotoxin and bicuculline  supporting the view that TETS acts by inhibiting type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor function. The effect of TETS on Ca²<U+207A> dynamics requires activation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors  because the changes induced by TETS were prevented by MK-801 block of NMDA receptors  but not nifedipine block of L-type Ca²<U+207A> channels. Pretreatment with the GABA(A) receptor-positive modulators diazepam and allopregnanolone partially mitigated TETS-induced changes in Ca²<U+207A> dynamics. Moreover  low  minimally effective concentrations of diazepam (0.1 µM) and allopregnanolone (0.1 µM)  when administered together  were highly effective in suppressing TETS-induced alterations in Ca²<U+207A> dynamics  suggesting that the combination of positive modulators of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors may have therapeutic potential. These rapid throughput in vitro assays may assist in the identification of single agents or combinations that have utility in the treatment of TETS intoxication."

AMPAR-mediated currents were recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons and dentate granule cells (DGCs) by voltage clamp technique. The surface expression of GluA2 subunit on hippocampal membranes was determined using a biotinylation assay. GluA2 internalization and changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca](i)) levels were studied in hippocampal cultures using immunocytochemical and live-imaging techniques. AMPAR antagonist treatment of SE was evaluated by video and electroencephalography.RESULTS: AMPAR-mediated currents recorded from CA1 neurons from refractory and late SE animals were inwardly rectifying  and philanthotoxin-sensitive; similar changes were observed in recordings obtained from DGCs from refractory SE animals. GluA2 subunit surface expression was reduced in the hippocampus during refractory and late SE. In cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons  recurrent bursting diminished surface expression of the GluA2 subunit and enhanced its internalization rate. Recurrent bursting-induced increase in [Ca](i) levels was reduced by selective inhibition of GluA2-lacking AMPARs. GYKI-52466 terminated diazepam-refractory SE.INTERPRETATION: During SE  there is rapid  ongoing plasticity of AMPARs with the expression of GluA2-lacking AMPARs. These receptors provide another source of Ca(2+) entry into the principal neurons. Benzodiazepam-refractory SE can be terminated by AMPAR antagonism. The data identify AMPARs as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of SE."

It was  however  T-maze and conditioned place preference (CPP) methods that allowed us to specifically establish learning/reward-related events operating in an ORX-A+GABA(A)R-dependent fashion in our experimental model. T-maze data showed that conditioned ORX-A treated-fish were capable of reaching the red/blue chamber and ingesting their food reward in a very greatly reduced latency time with respect to untreated conditioned fish while DZP and ZOL greatly and moderately (p&lt;0.05) reduced their latency time  respectively. Regarding CPP study  conditioned ORX-A- and DZP-treated animals showed comparably greater preferences for the conditioned compartment that became even greater in ORX-A+DZP-treated fish. Surprisingly  ORX receptor expression of the telencephalon was preferentially activated by ORX-A treatments while diencephalic/mesencephalic structures and namely the tuberculum posterioris (TPp) were more sensitive to DZP especially following treatment with ORX-A+DZP. Overall  behavioral performances along with ORX receptor transcriptional properties tend to point to a GABA(A)R agonists as enhancers of palatability while the ORXergic system constitutes a crucial link between satiety-related and cognitive centers through the activation of TPp thus proposing this ascending dopaminergic system as a key target of learning/reward processes in fish."

The receptor also mediates sleep in humans and animals. The aim of this study was to determine whether magnolol could modulate sleep behaviors by recording EEG and electromyogram in mice. The results showed that magnolol administered i.p. at a dose of 5 or 25 mg/kg could significantly shorten the sleep latency  increase the amount of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM  NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep for 3 h after administration with an increase in the number of NREM and REM sleep episodes. Magnolol at doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg increased the number of bouts of wakefulness but decreased their duration. On the other hand  magnolol increased the number of state transitions from wakefulness to NREM sleep and subsequently from NREM sleep to wakefulness. Immunohistochemical study showed that magnolol increased c-Fos expression in the neurons of ventrolateral preoptic area  a sleep center in the anterior hypothalamus  and decreased c-Fos expression in the arousal tuberomammillary nucleus  which was located in the caudolateral hypothalamus. The sleep-promoting effects and changes in c-Fos induced by magnolol were reversed by flumazenil  an antagonist at the benzodiazepine site of the GABA(A) receptor. These results indicate that magnolol increased NREM and REM sleep via the GABA(A) receptor."

First generation antihistamines can permeate the BBB and act in the central nervous system (CNS)  whereas entry to the CNS of second generation antihistamines is restricted by efflux pumps such as P-glycoprotein (P-gP) located in brain endothelial cells. P-gP functionality of PBMEC/C1-2 cells grown on Transwell filter inserts was proven by transport studies with P-gP substrate rhodamine 123 and P-gP blocker verapamil. Subsequent drug transport studies with the first generation antihistamines promethazine  diphenhydramine and pheniramine and the second generation antihistamines astemizole  ceterizine  fexofenadine and loratadine were accomplished in single substance as well as in group studies. Results were normalised to diazepam  an internal standard for the transcellular transport route. Moreover  effects after addition of P-gP inhibitor verapamil were investigated. First generation antihistamine pheniramine permeated as fastest followed by diphenhydramine  diazepam  promethazine and second generation antihistaminic drugs ceterizine  fexofenadine  astemizole and loratadine reflecting the BBB in vivo permeability ranking well. Verapamil increased the transport rates of all second generation antihistamines  which suggested involvement of P-gP during their permeation across the BBB model. The ranking after addition of verapamil was significantly changed  only fexofenadine and ceterizine penetrated slower than internal standard diazepam in the presence of verapamil. In summary  permeability data showed that the BBB model based on porcine cell line PBMEC/C1-2 was able to reflect the BBB in vivo situation for the transport of antihistaminc drugs and to distinguish between first and second generation antihistamines."

Moreover  protein kinase M zeta (PKM<U+03B6>) is critical for the maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial conditioned long-term memories. Also  a link between activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc)  PKM<U+03B6> and LTP has been proposed. Our previous results demonstrated that re-exposure to the withdrawal environment was able to evoke the memory acquired when the anxiety measured as a diazepam (DZ) withdrawal sign was experienced. In the present work we evaluated if the memory associated with DZ withdrawal could be affected by changes in the contextual cues presented during withdrawal and by intrahippocampal administration of a PKM<U+03B6> inhibitor. We found that the context was relevant for the expression of withdrawal signs as changes in contextual cues prevented the expression of the anxiety-like behavior observed during plus-maze (PM) re-exposure  the associated enhanced synaptic plasticity and the increase in Arc expression. Furthermore  intrahippocampal administration of PKM<U+03B6> inhibitor previous to re-exposure to the PM test also impaired expression of anxiety-like behavior and the facilitated LTP. These results support the relevance of the hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the maintenance of the memory trace during benzodiazepines withdrawal  adding new evidences for common mechanisms between memory and drug addiction that can be intervened for treatment or prevention of this pathology."

Although fast &quot;phasic&quot; inhibition arising through the activation of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) has been well described in the amygdala  much less is known about extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs mediating persistent or tonic inhibition and regulating neuronal excitability. Here  we recorded tonic currents in the basolateral (BLA) nucleus and the lateral (LA) nucleus of the amygdala. While all BLA principal cells expressed a robust GABAergic tonic current  only 70% of LA principal cells showed a tonic current. Immunohistochemical stainings revealed that the a3 GABA(A)R subunit is expressed moderately in the LA and strongly throughout the BLA nucleus  where it is located mostly at extrasynaptic sites. In a3 subunit KO mice  tonic currents are significantly reduced in BLA principal cells yet not in LA principal cells. Moreover  the a3 GABA(A)R-selective benzodiazepine site agonist and anxiolytic compound TP003 increases tonic currents and dampens excitability markedly in wild-type BLA principal cells but fails to do so in a3KO BLA cells. Interneurons of the LA and BLA nuclei also express a tonic current  but TP003-induced potentiation is seen in only a small fraction of these cells  suggesting that primarily other GABA(A)R variants underlie tonic inhibition in this cell type. Together  these studies demonstrate that a3 GABA(A)R-mediated tonic inhibition is a central component of the inhibitory force in the amygdala and that tonically activated a3 GABA(A)Rs present an important target for anxiolytic or fear-reducing compounds."

Although neuropathological changes have been intensively investigated in the hippocampus proper and the dentate gyrus in various seizure models  much less is known about changes in parahippocampal areas. We now established telemetric EEG recordings combined with continuous video monitoring to characterize the development of spontaneous seizures after KA-induced status epilepticus  and investigated associated neurodegenerative changes  astrocyte and microglia proliferation in the subiculum and other parahippocampal brain areas. The onset of spontaneous seizures was heterogeneous  with an average latency of 15 ± 1.4 days (range 3-36 days) to the initial status epilepticus. The frequency of late spontaneous seizures was higher in rats in which the initial status epilepticus was recurrent after its interruption with diazepam compared to rats in which this treatment was more efficient. Seizure-induced neuropathological changes were assessed in the subiculum by losses in NeuN-positive neurons and by Fluoro-Jade C staining of degenerating neurons. Neuronal loss was already prominent 24 h after KA injection and only modestly progressed at the later intervals. It was most severe in the proximal subiculum and in layer III of the medial entorhinal cortex and distinct Fluoro-Jade C labeling was observed there in 75% of rats even after 3 months. Glutamatergic neurons  labeled by in situ hybridization for the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 followed a similar pattern of cell losses  except for the medial entorhinal cortex and the proximal subiculum that appeared more vulnerable. Glutamate decarboxylase65 (GAD65) mRNA expressing neurons were generally less vulnerable than glutamate neurons. Reactive astrocytes and microglia were present after 24 h  however  became prominent only after 8 days and remained high after 30 days. In the proximal subiculum  parasubiculum and entorhinal cortex the number of microglia cells was highest after 30 days. Although numbers of reactive astrocytes and microglia were reduced again after 3 months  they were still present in most rats. The time course of astrocyte and microglia proliferation parallels that of epileptogenesis."
"202","22704937","Selective modulation of different GABAA receptor isoforms by diazepam and etomidate in hippocampal neurons.","Diazepam modulation of native <U+03B3>2-containing GABA(A) (<U+03B3>GABA(A)) receptors increases channel conductance by facilitating protein interactions involving the <U+03B3>2-subunit amphipathic (MA) region  which is found in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 (Everitt et al.  2009). However  many drugs  predicted to act on different GABA(A) receptor subtypes  increase channel conductance leading us to hypothesize that conductance variation in GABA(A) receptors may be a general property  mediated by protein interactions involving the cytoplasmic MA stretch of amino acids. In this study we have tested this hypothesis by potentiating extrasynaptic GABA(A) currents with etomidate and examining the ability of peptides mimicking either the <U+03B3>2- or d-subunit MA region to affect conductance. In inside-out hippocampal patches from newborn rats the general anesthetic etomidate potentiated GABA currents  producing either an increase in open probability and single-channel conductance or an increase in open probability  as described previously (Seymour et al.  2009). In patches displaying high conductance channels application of a d((392-422)) MA peptide  but not a scrambled version or the equivalent <U+03B3>2((381-403)) MA peptide  reduced the potentiating effects of etomidate  significantly reducing single-channel conductance. In contrast  when GABA currents were potentiated by the <U+03B3>2-specific drug diazepam the d MA peptide had no effect. These data reveal that diazepam and etomidate potentiate different extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor subtypes but both drugs modulate conductance similarly. One interpretation of the data is that these drugs elicit potentiation through protein interactions and that the MA peptides compete with these interactions to disrupt this process."
"203","22641177","An affective disorder in zebrafish with mutation of the glucocorticoid receptor.","Upon binding of cortisol  the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates the transcription of specific target genes  including those that encode the stress hormones corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Dysregulation of the stress axis is a hallmark of major depression in human patients. However  it is still unclear how glucocorticoid signaling is linked to affective disorders. We identified an adult-viable zebrafish mutant in which the negative feedback on the stress response is disrupted  due to abolition of all transcriptional activity of GR. As a consequence  cortisol is elevated  but unable to signal through GR. When placed into an unfamiliar aquarium ('novel tank')  mutant fish become immobile ('freeze')  show reduced exploratory behavior and do not habituate to this stressor upon repeated exposure. Addition of the antidepressant fluoxetine to the holding water and social interactions restore normal behavior  followed by a delayed correction of cortisol levels. Fluoxetine does not affect the overall transcription of CRH  the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)  the serotonin transporter (Serta) or GR itself. Fluoxetine  however  suppresses the stress-induced upregulation of MR and Serta in both wild-type fish and mutants. Our studies show a conserved  protective function of glucocorticoid signaling in the regulation of emotional behavior and reveal novel molecular aspects of how chronic stress impacts vertebrate brain physiology and behavior. Importantly  the zebrafish model opens up the possibility of high-throughput drug screens in search of new classes of antidepressants."

It has been reported to have sedative and anti-epileptic effects  but its hypnotic effects remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of safranal on sleep-wake cycle.METHODS: We established hypnotic-model mice treated with a low dose of pentobarbital 20 mg/kg  and administered different doses of safranal  vehicle  or diazepam. The change of sleep-wake cycle was assessed by sleep recording and c-Fos expression in the brain was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Safranal increased the duration of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep  shortened NREM sleep latency  and enhanced the delta power activity of NREM sleep. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed that safranal increased c-Fos expression in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO)  one of the putative sleep centers  and decreased it in the arousal histaminergic tuberomammillary nuclei (TMN).CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that safranal enhances NREM sleep in pentobarbital-treated mice. The hypnotic effects of safranal may be related to the activation of the sleep-promoting neurons in the VLPO and the simultaneous inhibition of the wakefulness-promoting neurons in the TMN  suggesting that safranal may be a hypnotic substance."

To investigate their possible association with neuronal damage  the changes in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)  laminin and neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) immunoreactivities were analyzed in rats treated with pilocarpine (380 mg/kg) or kainate (15 mg/kg)  and receiving diazepam (20mg/kg) after 10 min of SE. A different group of rats was injected with endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the caudate putamen to reproduce the changes in GFAP and laminin immunoreactivities associated with ischemia. Focal loss of GFAP immunostaining was accompanied by increased laminin immunoreactivity in blood vessels  in all the examined groups. Regression analysis revealed a significant (P&lt;0.01) relationship between astrocytic lesion and increased laminin immunoreactivity in the piriform cortex (Pir) of both pilocarpine (R(2)=0.88) and kainate (R(2)=0.94) groups of treatment. A significant relationship (P&lt;0.01; R(2)=0.81) was also present in the cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3) hippocampal region of pilocarpine-treated rats. At variance  neuronal and glial lesions were significantly related (P&lt;0.05  R(2)=0.74) only in the substantia nigra of pilocarpine-treated rats. The ratio between areas of GFAP and laminin changes of immunoreactivity in the ET-1 group was similar to those found in pilocarpine- and kainate-treated rats in specific brain regions  such as the hippocampal CA3 subfield  Pir and the anterior olfactory nucleus. The amygdala and submedius thalamic nucleus in the pilocarpine group  and the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices in the kainate group  also presented ischemic-like changes. These results indicate that laminin immunoreactivity is upregulated in the basal lamina of blood vessels after SE induced by pilocarpine or kainate. This phenomenon is significantly associated with lesions involving more glial than neuronal cells  in specific cerebral regions."

Hypothalamic orexin neurons have input-output projections to the amygdala; they modulate vigilance and stress-related responses.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the transient pharmacological blockade of orexin receptors moderates the conditioned fear response.METHODS: F344 rats received acute oral treatment with the dual orexin receptor antagonist almorexant (30-300 mg/kg) or with one of the clinically effective anxiolytics diazepam (1-10 mg/kg)  buspirone (10-100 mg/kg)  fluoxetine (3-30 mg/kg)  and sertraline (10-100 mg/kg). Drug effects on startle responses were assessed in both fear- and non-fear-conditioned rats; on forepaw grip and horizontal wire motor performance  and on elevated plus maze (EPM) behavior.RESULTS: Diazepam and almorexant both dose-dependently decreased FPS in the presence of the fear-conditioned stimulus (CS; light) more prominently than background startle in absence of the CS (dark). Diazepam induced myorelaxation and reduced startle responses in control non-fear-conditioned rats. Almorexant had no myorelaxant effects and left startle responses under light in non-fear-conditioned rats intact. On the EPM  diazepam showed anxiolytic-like effects  almorexant not. Buspirone demonstrated anxiolytic-like effects on FPS by simultaneously reducing CS-related startle and increasing no-CS-background startle. Fluoxetine did not affect FPS  whereas sertraline showed anxiogenic-like effects.CONCLUSIONS: Almorexant reduced FPS  but did not affect EPM behavior. Almorexant's overall pattern of effects on FPS was comparable to but less pronounced than that of the anxiolytic benzodiazepine diazepam. The endogenous orexin system actively contributes to fear-conditioned startle reactions in the rat."

In the cerebellum  one-to-one connection from excitatory climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell (PC) is established by elimination of early-formed surplus CFs. This process depends on glutamatergic excitatory inputs  but contribution of GABAergic transmission remains unclear. Here  we demonstrate impaired CF synapse elimination in mouse models with diminished GABAergic transmission by mutation of a single allele for the GABA synthesizing enzyme GAD67  by conditional deletion of GAD67 from PCs and GABAergic interneurons or by pharmacological inhibition of cerebellar GAD activity. The impaired CF synapse elimination was rescued by enhancing GABA(A) receptor sensitivity in the cerebellum by locally applied diazepam. Our electrophysiological and Ca2+ imaging data suggest that GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition onto the PC soma from molecular layer interneurons influences CF-induced Ca2+ transients in the soma and regulates CF synapse elimination from postnatal day 10 (P10) to around P16."

In these epileptic rats  a unique redistribution of the CB(1) receptor occurs within the hippocampus; however  an anatomically inclusive analysis of the effect of status epilepticus (SE)-induced AE on CB(1) receptors has not been thoroughly evaluated. Therefore  statistical parametric mapping (SPM)  a whole-brain unbiased approach  was used to study the long-term effect of pilocarpine-induced SE on CB(1) -receptor binding and G-protein activation in rats with AE.METHODS:   Serial coronal sections from control and epileptic rats were cut at equal intervals throughout the neuraxis and processed for [(3) H]WIN55 212-2 (WIN) autoradiography  WIN-stimulated [(35) S]GTP<U+03B3>S autoradiography  and CB(1) -receptor immunohistochemistry (IHC). The autoradiographic techniques were evaluated with both region of interest (ROI) and SPM analyses.KEY FINDINGS:   In rats with AE  regionally specific increases in CB(1) -receptor binding and activity were detected in cortex  discrete thalamic nuclei  and other regions including caudate-putamen and septum  and confirmed by IHC. However  CB(1) receptors were unaltered in several brain regions  including substantia nigra and cerebellum  and did not exhibit regional decreases in rats with AE.SIGNIFICANCE:   This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of the regional distribution of changes in CB(1) -receptor expression  binding  and G-protein activation in the rat pilocarpine model of AE. These regions may ultimately serve as targets for cannabinomimetic compounds or manipulation of the endocannabinoid system in epileptic brain."

However  its therapeutic effect on pediatric status epilepticus (SE) is still unknown. We conducted a study to investigate whether hypothermia can have an adjuvant effect on pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in immature rats when combined with diazepam treatment. Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus was maintained for either 30 min or 60 min  which was followed by injection with diazepam (10mg/kg body weight) and/or treatment with mild hypothermia (core temperature to 33°C). We found that the spike-wave amplitude and frequency after SE during treatment with diazepam and hypothermia was significantly lower than treatment with diazepam alone. Mild hypothermia significantly reduced the number of cells undergoing necrosis and apoptosis. In addition  a-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR1 was shown to be up-regulated by SE  while GluR2 was shown to be down-regulated. However  after combination therapy with diazepam and mild hypothermia for 8h  the expression of GluR1 was decreased and GluR2 was increased relative to the levels of diazepam alone treated juveniles. We also found that the expression of mGluR-1a was also decreased relative to diazepam alone. These findings suggest that mild hypothermia might further protect against pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in immature rats by regulating glutamate receptor expression. This study was conducted using a pediatric model of SE so as to gain a better understanding of the role of hypothermia in the developing brain."

However  there is no specific mouse model of catamenial epilepsy. In this study  we developed and characterized a mouse model of catamenial epilepsy by using the neurosteroid-withdrawal paradigm. It is hypothesized that seizure susceptibility decreases when neurosteroid levels are high (midluteal phase) and increases during their withdrawal (perimenstrual periods) in close association with GABA(A) receptor plasticity. A chronic seizure condition was created by using the hippocampus kindling model in female mice. Elevated neurosteroid levels were induced by sequential gonadotropin treatment  and withdrawal was induced by the neurosteroid synthesis inhibitor finasteride. Elevated neurosteroid exposure reduced seizure expression in fully kindled mice. Fully kindled mice subjected to neurosteroid withdrawal showed increased generalized seizure frequency and intensity and enhanced seizure susceptibility. They also showed reduced benzodiazepine sensitivity and enhanced neurosteroid potency  similar to the clinical catamenial seizure phenotype. The increased susceptibility to seizures and alterations in antiseizure drug responses are associated with increased abundance of the a4 and d subunits of GABA(A) receptors in the hippocampus. These findings demonstrate that endogenous neurosteroids protect against seizure susceptibility and their withdrawal  such as that which occurs during menstruation  leads to exacerbation of seizure activity. This is possibly caused by specific changes in GABA(A) receptor-subunit plasticity and function  therefore providing a novel mouse model of human perimenstrual catamenial epilepsy that can be used for the investigation of disease mechanisms and new therapeutic approaches."

The purpose of this study was to examine the consequences of EE (or isolation housing) on a range of behavioural pharmacological tests and brain monoamine and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the rat. Male rats were randomly assigned to IC (isolation)  SC (standard group-housed) or EE conditions. IC and SC animals were housed singly or in groups of four in standard cages  whilst the EE group were housed in groups of four in larger cages enriched with a variety of wooden  cardboard and plastic objects. After 5weeks of housing  its impact on the effects of diazepam (DZP) in the elevated plus maze (EPM); desipramine (DMI) in the forced swim test (FST) and amphetamine (AMP) effects on homecage activity were assessed. Post-mortem monoamine and BDNF levels were analysed using HPLC and ELISA. EE rats displayed reduced activity in the OFT  however no other differences were found in baseline behaviours. DMI reduced immobility time in the FST  but only for rats housed in IC  while AMP effects were somewhat greater for socially-housed animals than those in IC. There were no housing effects on monoamine or BDNF levels in discreet brain regions. The results suggest that post-weaning enrichment had no significant effect on baseline behaviours or monoamine and BDNF levels  thus it is suitable to implement as a commonplace husbandry practice  however  caution must be taken when investigating responsiveness to psychotropic drugs."

The behavioral changes of the rats were evaluated using plus-maze test  after which the rats in normal control group  model group  and medium AFS dose group were sacrificed to measure the hippocampal contents of glutamic acid and <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid (GABA) using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); immunohistochemistry was employed to evaluate the expressions of GABAA receptor and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1).RESULTS: Plus-maze test showed obvious anxiety behaviors in the model group  which were significantly meliorated by diazepam and ASF  especially at the medium dose. Hippocampal glutamate levels increased and GABA decreased significantly in the model group  and such changes were obviously attenuated  by comparable amplitudes  by treatments with diazepam and medium-dose ASF. The model group showed significantly diminished GABAA receptor-positive cells and increased NMDAR1-positive cells  which were improved by diazepam and ASF at the medium dose.CONCLUSION: ASF produces strong anxiolytic effect in rats by increasing the content of GABA in the brain  enhancing GABAA receptor expression  reducing glutamic acid content  and decreasing NMDAR1 expression."

TSPO has been implicated in various functions  including apoptosis and steroidogenesis  among others. Various endogenous TSPO ligands have been proposed  for example: Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI)  triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN)  phospholipase A2 (PLA2)  and protoporphyrin IX. However  the functional implications of interactions between the TSPO and its putative endogenous ligands still have to be firmly established. The TSPO has been suggested to interact with a mitochondrial protein complex  summarized as mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (MPTP)  which is considered to regulate the mitochondrial membrane potential (<U+0394><U+03A8>m). In addition  the TSPO is associated with several other proteins. The associations of the TSPO with these various proteins at the mitochondrial membranes have been attributed to functions such as apoptosis  steroidogenesis  phosphorylation  reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation  ATP production  and collapse of the <U+0394><U+03A8>m. Interestingly  while TSPO is known to play a role in the modulation of steroid production  in turn  steroids are also known to affect TSPO expression. As with the putative endogenous TSPO ligands  the effects of steroids on TSPO functions still have to be established. In any case  steroid-TSPO interactions occur in organs and tissues as diverse as the reproductive system  kidney  and brain. In general  the steroid-TSPO interactions are thought to be part of stress responses  but may also be essential for reproductive events  embryonic development  and responses to injury  including brain injury. The present review focuses on the role of TSPO in cell death i.e. the notion that enhanced expression and/or activation of the TSPO leads to cell death  and the potential of steroids to regulate TSPO expression and activation."

However  little is known about how psychotropic drugs affect the mechanism of the human response to mental stress. We investigated the influence of psychotropic drugs on plasma BDNF levels under mental stress using a driving simulator (DS) task.METHODS: Fourteen healthy male volunteers received one of four drugs  diazepam (5<U+2009>mg)  tandospirone (20<U+2009>mg)  paroxetine (10<U+2009>mg)  and matched placebo  in a double-blind  crossover manner. Subjects were asked to perform the DS task 4<U+2009>h post-dosing. Plasma BDNF levels were measured before and after the DS task.RESULTS: Plasma BDNF levels under the placebo  diazepam  and tandospirone conditions significantly decreased after the DS task compared with before the task. Conversely  no significant differences in plasma BDNF levels were detected under the paroxetine condition.CONCLUSION: As these three psychotropic drugs have differential effects on plasma BDNF levels under mental stress after 4<U+2009>h post-dosing  antidepressants  unlike anxiolytics  might have a prompt positive effect on the mental stress response."

Pharmacokinetic studies in animal models are the important components in clinical development of this agent. In this study  a rapid and sensitive analytical method based on high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been developed for the determination of felotaxel in tumor-bearing mice plasma  urine  feces and tissues (brain  heart  liver  lung and kidney and tumor). For all matrices  sample preparation involved liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. Calibration curves (1/x² weighted) offered satisfactory linearity (r² = 0.995) within the test range. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for all matrices was 10 ng/ml except that for mouse plasma and brain LLOQ was 1 ng/ml. The accuracy and precision ranged from 86.1 to 107.2% and 1.1 to 9.2%  respectively. Recoveries (73.9-96.1%) and matrix effects (76.4-97.2%) were satisfactory in all the biological matrices examined.

"216","22248636","Behavioural phenotypic characterization of CD-1 mice lacking the neuropeptide S receptor.","Neuropeptide S (NPS) is the endogenous ligand of a previously orphan receptor now named NPSR. In the brain NPS regulates several biological functions including anxiety  arousal  locomotion  food intake  learning and memory  pain and drug abuse. Mice lacking the NPSR gene (NPSR(-/-)) represent an useful tool to investigate the neurobiology of the NPS/NPSR system. NPSR(-/-) mice have been generated in a 129S6/SvEv genetic background. In the present study we generated CD-1 congenic NPSR(+/+) and NPSR(-/-) mice and investigated their phenotype and sensitivity to NPS in various behavioural assays. The phenotype analysis revealed no locomotor differences between NPSR(+/+) and NPSR(-/-) mice. The behaviour of NPSR(+/+) and NPSR(-/-) mice in the righting reflex test was superimposable. No differences were recorded between the two genotypes in the elevated plus maze  open field and stress-induced hyperthermia tests  with the exception of rearing behaviour that was reduced in knockout animals. Moreover the behaviour of NPSR(+/+) and NPSR(-/-) mice in the forced swimming  novel object recognition and formalin assays was similar. The stimulatory effects of NPS in the locomotor activity test and its anxiolytic-like actions in the elevated plus maze and open field assays were evident in NPSR(+/+) but not NPSR(-/-) animals. In conclusion  the present study indicates that the NPS/NPSR system does not tonically control locomotion  sensitivity to diazepam  anxiety  depressive-like behaviours  memory and pain transmission in mice. Furthermore our results clearly show that the product of the NPSR gene represents the mandatory protein for all the NPS biological effects so far described."

The standard emergency treatment comprising of anticholinergic  AChE reactivator and anticonvulsant does not completely protect against soman toxicity. We have evaluated imidazenil  a new anticonvulsant imidazo benzodiazepine with high affinity and intrinsic efficacy at a5-  a2-  and a3- but low intrinsic efficacy at a1-containing GABA(A) receptors and is devoid of cardiorespiratory depression  sedative/hypnoitc and amnestic actions and does not elicit tolerance and dependence liabilities unlike diazepam  for protection against soman toxicity. Guinea pigs implanted with bipotential radiotelemetry probes for recording EEG and ECG were administered with 26 µg/kg pyridostigmine bromide 30 min prior to 2× LD(50) soman exposure and 1 min later treated with a combination of 2mg/kg atropine sulfate and 25mg/kg 2-pralidoxime and various doses of imidazenil. Intramuscular administration of imidazenil  dose-dependently protected against 2× LD(50) of soman toxicity up to 1mg/kg. Further increase in the dose of imidazenil to 2.5mg/kg was less effective than 1mg/kg probably due to non-specific actions at sites other than GABA(A) receptors. Compared to vehicle group  1mg/kg imidazenil treatment showed optimal increase in survival rate  reduction in behavioral manifestations and high power of EEG spectrum as well as neuronal necrosis. These data suggest that imidazenil is an effective anticonvulsant for medical countermeasure against soman-induced toxicity."

"219","22226357","Diazepam binding inhibitor promotes progenitor proliferation in the postnatal SVZ by reducing GABA signaling.","The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles is the largest neurogenic niche of the postnatal brain. New SVZ-generated neurons migrate via the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb (OB) where they functionally integrate into preexisting neuronal circuits. Nonsynaptic GABA signaling was previously shown to inhibit SVZ-derived neurogenesis. Here we identify the endogenous protein diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) as a positive modulator of SVZ postnatal neurogenesis by regulating GABA activity in transit-amplifying cells. We performed DBI loss- and gain-of-function experiments in vivo at the peak of postnatal OB neuron generation in mice and demonstrate that DBI enhances proliferation by preventing SVZ progenitors to exit the cell cycle. Furthermore  we provide evidence that DBI exerts its effect on SVZ progenitors via its octadecaneuropeptide proteolytic product (ODN) by inhibiting GABA-induced currents. Together our data reveal a regulatory mechanism by which DBI counteracts the inhibitory effect of nonsynaptic GABA signaling on subventricular neuronal proliferation."

Different brain areas and neuronal populations most likely mediate these different behavioral effects. We used c-Fos immunohistochemistry as an indirect way to study neuronal activation or inhibition induced by DZ at anxiolytic and sedative doses (0.5 and 5mg/kg  respectively) in various brain areas involved in anxiety  arousal  sedation and addiction in C57BL/6J mice. We also focused on the two neuronal populations  orexinergic and dopaminergic neuronal populations  with the help of double-immunohistochemistry using c-Fos and orexin-A antibodies and c-Fos and tyrosine hydroxylase antibodies. We found that different brain areas of unhabituated mice reacted differently to the mild stress induced by vehicle injection. Also the response to anxiolytic or sedative doses of DZ differed between the areas  suggesting that distinct brain areas mediate the behavioral effects of low and high DZ doses. Our findings propose a role for inhibition of orexin neurons in the anxiolytic and sleep-promoting effects of DZ. In addition  the activation of central amygdala neurons by DZ treatment was associated with anxiolytic and sedative effects. On the other hand  the ventral hippocampus  basolateral amygdala  ventral tegmental area and prefrontal cortex were sensitive even to the mild injection stress  but not to the anxiolytic dose of DZ."

These experiments tested the hypothesis that the number of GnRH neurons is reduced in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The effects of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) and the subsequent spontaneous recurrent eizures on the number of GnRH-positive neurons were studied in adult female mice. Systemic injections of pilocarpine were used to induce SE  and diazepam was administered 90 min after the first seizure. Control mice received all drugs except pilocarpine. The mice were euthanized either 1 week or 3 months after SE (i.e. after spontaneous recurrent seizures were observed). Even though the estrous cycle was disrupted after SE  and hippocampal damage was detected in both the CA1 and CA3 regions  pilocarpine-treated mice did not show a significant decrease in total or regional numbers of GnRH-immunopositive neurons. Therefore  these data do not support the hypothesis that a reduction in the number of GnRH neurons is responsible for the disruption of the estrous cycle after pilocarpine-induced epilepsy  which suggests that other mechanisms contribute to female reproductive disorders associated with chronic epilepsy."

In addition  the expression levels of NMDAR1 and c-Jun were measured to establish a possible signaling mechanism for hypothermia-induced neuroprotection. Pilocarpine-treated rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: group D (diazepam) and group DH (diazepam plus hypothermia). Compared to the control (group NS) rats  Pilocarpine-induced SE significantly enhanced the expression of NMDAR1 and c-Jun in the hippocampus  and also significantly increased the numbers of necrotic and apoptotic pyramidal neurons. The DH group exhibited significantly fewer necrotic and apoptotic hippocampal pyramidal neurons and reduced NMDAR1 expression than group D. In contrast  early expression of c-Jun was significantly higher in the hippocampi of hypothermia-treated rats than in the hippocampi of group D  while late c-Jun expression was significantly lesser than group D. Our results show mild post-ictal hypothermia partially rescues neuronal cell death in the hippocampus following SE. We further suggest that elevated NMDAR1 expression exacerbates SE-induced neuronal death in pilocarpine-treated rats  while early c-Jun overexpression  concomitant with hypothermia  suppresses subsequent neuronal death."

The present study designed four preclinical experiments to determine the effects of BZDs using chronic unpredictable stress model. In Experiment 1  several time course studies on behavior and hippocampus response to stress were conducted using the forced swim and tail suspension tests (FST and TST) as well as hippocampal structural plasticity markers. Chronic stress induced depression-like behavior in the FST and TST as well as decreased hippocampal structural plasticity that returned to normal within 3 wk. In Experiment 2  mice received p.o. administration of three diazepam dosages prior to each variate stress session for 4 wk. This treatment significantly antagonized the elevation of stress-induced corticosterone levels. Only low- (0.5mg/kg) and medium-dose (1mg/kg) diazepam blocked the detrimental effects of chronic stress. In Experiment 3  after 7 wk of stress sessions  daily p.o. diazepam administration during 1 wk recovery phase dose-dependently accelerated the recovery of stressed mice. In Experiment 4  1 wk diazepam administration to control mice enhanced significantly hippocampal structural plasticity and induced an antidepressant-like behavioral effect  whereas 4 wk diazepam administration produced opposite effects. Hence  diazepam can slow the progress of chronic stress-induced detrimental consequences by normalizing glucocorticoid hormones. Considering the adverse effect of long-term diazepam administration on hippocampal plasticity  the preventive effects of diazepam may depend on the proper dose. Short-term diazepam treatment enhances hippocampal structural plasticity and is beneficial to recovery following chronic stress."
"224","22180776","GABA regulates the multidirectional tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons in living neonatal mice.","Cortical GABAergic interneurons originate from ganglionic eminences and tangentially migrate into the cortical plate at early developmental stages. To elucidate the characteristics of this migration of GABAergic interneurons in living animals  we established an experimental design specialized for in vivo time-lapse imaging of the neocortex of neonate mice with two-photon laser-scanning microscopy. In vesicular GABA/glycine transporter (VGAT)-Venus transgenic mice from birth (P0) through P3  we observed multidirectional tangential migration of genetically-defined GABAergic interneurons in the neocortical marginal zone. The properties of this migration  such as the motility rate (distance/hr)  the direction moved  and the proportion of migrating neurons to stationary neurons  did not change through P0 to P3  although the density of GABAergic neurons at the marginal zone decreased with age. Thus  the characteristics of the tangential motility of individual GABAergic neurons remained constant in development. Pharmacological block of GABA(A) receptors and of the Na<U+207A>-K<U+207A>-Cl<U+207B> cotransporters  and chelating intracellular Ca²<U+207A>  all significantly reduced the motility rate in vivo. The motility rate and GABA content within the cortex of neonatal VGAT-Venus transgenic mice were significantly greater than those of GAD67-GFP knock-in mice  suggesting that extracellular GABA concentration could facilitate the multidirectional tangential migration. Indeed  diazepam applied to GAD67-GFP mice increased the motility rate substantially. In an in vitro neocortical slice preparation  we confirmed that GABA induced a NKCC sensitive depolarization of GABAergic interneurons in VGAT-Venus mice at P0-P3. Thus  activation of GABA(A)R by ambient GABA depolarizes GABAergic interneurons  leading to an acceleration of their multidirectional motility in vivo."

However  the signaling mechanisms underlying the role of GABA(A) receptor modulation in memory retrieval are unclear. We conducted one-trial passive avoidance task with pre-retention trial drug administration in the hippocampus to test the effects of GABA(A) receptor modulation on memory retrieval. We further tested the co-involvement of signaling molecules: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)  Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)  and cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB). First  we observed that the phosphorylation of hippocampal ERK was required for memory retrieval during the task. Accordingly  to investigate whether GABA(A) receptor activation or inhibition induces ERK phosphorylation during memory retrieval  drugs that target the GABA(A) receptor were administered into the hippocampus before the retention trial. Muscimol  a GABA(A) receptor agonist  and diazepam  an agonist to benzodiazepine-binding site of GABA(A) receptor  blocked retention trial-induced ERK phosphorylation and impaired memory retrieval. Furthermore  co-treatment with sub-effective dose of U0126  a mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor  blocked the upregulation of ERK phosphorylation and impaired memory retrieval  and bicuculline methiodide (BMI)  a GABA(A) receptor antagonist  increased ERK phosphorylation induced by the retention trial and facilitated memory retrieval. Finally  the effects of BMI were blocked by the co-application of a sub-effective dose of U0126. These results suggest that GABA(A) receptor-mediated memory retrieval is closely related to ERK activity."

Activity-dependent transcription of genes for neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to promote epileptogenesis; however  little is known about factors that may act as intrinsic  homeostatic or counterbalancing mechanisms. Using rodent models  here we show that limbic seizure activity upregulated NRG1-ErbB4 signaling and that epileptogenesis was inhibited by infusing NRG1 intracerebrally but exacerbated by neutralizing endogenous NRG1 with soluble ErbB4 extracellular domain  by inhibiting ErbB4 activation or by deleting the Erbb4 gene. Furthermore  specific depletion of ErbB4 in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons abolished NRG1-mediated inhibition of epileptogenesis and promoted kindling progression  resulting in increased spontaneous seizures and exuberant mossy fiber sprouting. In contrast  depleting ErbB4 in CaMKIIa-positive pyramidal neurons had no effect. Thus  NRG1-induced activation of ErbB4 in parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons may serve as a critical endogenous negative-feedback mechanism to suppress limbic epileptogenesis."

The study reported herein evaluated the anticonvulsant activity of SPD in a battery of rodent seizure and epilepsy models and assessed its efficacy in rat and guinea pig models of status epilepticus (SE) and neuroprotection in an organotypic hippocampal slice model of excitotoxic cell death.METHODS: The anticonvulsant activity of SPD was evaluated in several rodent seizure and epilepsy models  including maximal electroshock (MES)  6-Hz psychomotor; subcutaneous (s.c.) metrazol-  s.c. picrotoxin  s.c. bicuculline  and audiogenic  corneal  and hippocampal kindled seizures following intraperitoneal administration. Results obtained with SPD are discussed in relationship to those obtained with VPA and VCD. SPD was also evaluated for its ability to block benzodiazepine-resistant SE induced by pilocarpine (rats) and soman (rats and guinea pigs) following intraperitoneal administration. SPD was tested for its ability to block excitotoxic cell death induced by the glutamate agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainic acid (KA) using organotypic hippocampal slices and SE-induced hippocampal cell death using FluoroJade B staining. The cognitive function of SPD-treated rats that were protected against pilocarpine-induced convulsive SE was examined 10-14 days post-SE using the Morris water maze (MWM). The relationship between the pharmacokinetic profile of SPD and its efficacy against soman-induced SE was evaluated in two parallel studies following SPD (60 mg/kg  i.p.) administration in the soman SE rat model.KEY FINDINGS: SPD was highly effective and displayed a wide protective index (PI = median neurotoxic dose/median effective dose [TD(50)/ED(50)]) in the standardized seizure and epilepsy models employed. The wide PI values of SPD demonstrate that it is effective at doses well below those that produce behavioral impairment. Unlike VCD  SPD also displayed anticonvulsant activity in the rat pilocarpine model of SE. Thirty minutes after the induction of SE  the calculated rat ED(50) for SPD against convulsive SE in this model was 84 mg/kg. SPD was not neuroprotective in the organotypic hippocampal slice preparation; however  it did display hippocampal neuroprotection in both SE models and cognitive sparing in the MWM  which was associated with its antiseizure effect against pilocarpine-induced SE. When administered 20 and 40 min after SE onset  SPD (100-174 mg/kg) produced long-lasting efficacy (e.g.  4-8 h) against soman-induced convulsive and electrographic SE in both rats and guinea pigs. SPD ED(50) values in guinea pigs were 67 and 92 mg/kg when administered at SE onset or 40 min after SE onset  respectively. Assuming linear pharmacokinetics (PK)  the PK-PD (pharmacodynamic) results (rats) suggests that effective SPD plasma levels ranged between 8 and 40 mg/L (20 min after the onset of soman-induced seizures) and 12-50 mg/L (40 min after the onset of soman-induced seizures). The time to peak (t(max)) pharmacodynamic effect (PD-t(max)) occurred after the PK-t(max)  suggesting that SPD undergoes slow distribution to extraplasmatic sites  which is likely responsible for antiseizure activity of SPD.SIGNIFICANCE: The results demonstrate that SPD is a broad-spectrum antiseizure compound that blocks SE induced by pilocarpine and soman and affords in vivo neuroprotection that is associated with cognitive sparing. Its activity against SE is superior to that of diazepam in terms of rapid onset  potency  and its effect on animal mortality and functional improvement."

It is a common disorder in older persons and has become more prevalent today. The fresh leaves of Murraya koenigii are often added to various dishes in Asian countries due to the delicious taste and flavor that they impart. These leaves have also been proven to have health benefits. In the present study  the effect of total alkaloidal extract from M. koenigii leaves (MKA) on cognitive functions and brain cholinesterase activity in mice were determined. In vitro ß-secretase 1 (BACE1) inhibitory activity was also evaluated. The total alkaloidal extract was administered orally in three doses (10  20 and 30 mg/kg) for 15 days to different groups of young and aged mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam-  scopolamine-  and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. MKA (20 and 30 mg/kg  p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. Furthermore  the same doses of MKA reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg  i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg  i.p.). Interestingly  the brain cholinesterase activity was also reduced significantly by total alkaloidal extract of M. koenigii leaves. The IC50 value of MKA against BACE1 was 1.7 µg/mL. In conclusion  this study indicates MKA to be a useful remedy in the management of Alzheimer's disease and dementia."

The PRIP-1 subtype is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system and binds directly to the GABA type A receptor (GABA(A)-R) ß-subunit and several other proteins involved in the trafficking of GABA(A)-Rs to the plasma membrane. We found that the PRIP-1 knockout mouse showed an epileptic phenotype  confirmed by electroencephalogram. These ictal seizures were completely suppressed by diazepam (DZP)  but the interictal discharges could not be abolished. We studied the electrophysiological properties of GABAergic transmission in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons  using a slice patch-clamp technique. There was no difference in the effect of up to 1 µM DZP on the amplitude and frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents between PRIP-1 knockout neurons versus wild-type neurons. In contrast  the amplitude of the tonic GABA current in PRIP-1 knockout neurons was markedly reduced compared with that in wild-type neurons. Consequently  the effect of DZP on PRIP-1 knockout mice was reduced. Dysfunction of extrasynaptic GABAergic transmission probably is involved in the epileptic phenotype of PRIP-1 knockout mice."

From 5th to 15th day the animals in different groups were administered daily with varying doses of hydroethanolic extract of Passiflora incarnata (150  300  and 600mg/kg; i.p.)  diazepam (2mg/kg; i.p.) and vehicle. On every 5th day  after PTZ treatment  seizure severity (score) was noted. Following convulsive episodes the locomotor activity (using actophotometer) and immobility period (using forced swim test) were also determined. On 15th day after behavioral assessment  the brain serotonin and noradrenaline levels were determined using spectrofluorometric methods.RESULTS: Treatment with the extract significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced the seizure severity and immobility period as compared to vehicle control  in a dose and time-dependent manner. Moreover  the extract treatment retained the serotonin and noradrenaline levels of the brain.CONCLUSIONS: The results of present study concluded that the hydroethanolic extract of Passiflora incarnata suppress PTZ-induced seizures  and ameliorates its associated post-ictal depression  which has been found to be get worsened with the standard antiepileptic drug  diazepam."

Male rhesus monkeys were shaved on the dorsal area  attached with a matrix-type patch with various sizes (2×2 to 7×7 cm) for 24 or 72 h  and challenged with 2×LD50 doses (13µg/kg) of soman. The smallest patch size for the protection against lethality induced by soman intoxication was 3×3cm  resulting in blood procyclidine concentration of 10.8 ng/ml  blood physostigmine concentration of 0.54 ng/ml  which are much lower concentrations than maximum sign-free doses  and blood cholinesterase inhibition of 42%. The drug concentrations and enzyme inhibition rate corresponding to a diverging point of survivability were presumably estimated to be around 7 ng/ml for procyclidine  0.35 ng/ml for physostigmine  and 37% of enzyme inhibition. Separately  in combination with the patch treatment  the post treatment consisting of atropine (0.5 mg/kg) plus 1-[([4-(aminocarbonyl)pyridinio]methoxy)methyl]-2-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]pyridinium (HI-6  50 mg/kg) exerted protection against 5×LD50 challenge of soman  which means the posttreatment remarkably augmented the efficacy of the patch. Additionally  it was found that brain injuries induced by soman toxicity were effectively prevented by the patch treatment according to histopathological examinations. These results suggest that the patch system could be an effective alternative for diazepam  an anticonvulsant  and the current pyridostigmine pretreatment  and especially in combination with atropine plus HI-6  could be a choice for quality survival from nerve-agent poisoning."

The LTR subgroup presented a shorter diazepam-induced sleeping time compared to that of the HTR subgroup. Biochemical assays revealed that the LTR subgroup did not differ in [(3)H]-flunitrazepam binding compared to the HTR subgroup. With respect to the binding of [(3)H]-Ro 15-4513  the LTR subgroup had higher binding in the brainstem and lower binding in the striatum compared to the HTR subgroup.

Intruder rats that were defeated by a dominant resident conspecific exhibited a rapid increase in abdominal temperature by up to 2.0<U+200A> °C. In these defeated rats  we found that expression of Fos  a marker of neuronal activation  was increased in the rostral medullary raphe region centered in the rostral raphe pallidus and adjacent raphe magnus nuclei. In this region  Fos expression was observed in a large population of neurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3)  which are known as sympathetic premotor neurons controlling non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and thermoregulatory constriction of skin blood vessels  and also in a small population of tryptophan hydroxylase-positive serotonergic neurons. Intraperitoneal injection of diazepam  an anxiolytic agent  but not indomethacin  an antipyretic  significantly reduced both the stress-induced hyperthermia and Fos expression in these medullary raphe neuronal populations. Systemic blockade of ß3 -adrenoreceptors  which are abundantly expressed in BAT  also attenuated the stress-induced hyperthermia. These results suggest that psychological stress signals activate VGLUT3-expressing medullary raphe sympathetic premotor neurons  which then drive hyperthermic effector responses including BAT thermogenesis through ß(3) -adrenoreceptors."

"235","21915341","Differential susceptibility of interneurons expressing neuropeptide Y or parvalbumin in the aged hippocampus to acute seizure activity.","Acute seizure (AS) activity in old age has an increased predisposition for evolving into temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Furthermore  spontaneous seizures and cognitive dysfunction after AS activity are often intense in the aged population than in young adults. This could be due to an increased vulnerability of inhibitory interneurons in the aged hippocampus to AS activity. We investigated this issue by comparing the survival of hippocampal GABA-ergic interneurons that contain the neuropeptide Y (NPY) or the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) between young adult (5-months old) and aged (22-months old) F344 rats at 12 days after three-hours of AS activity. Graded intraperitoneal injections of the kainic acid (KA) induced AS activity and a diazepam injection at 3 hours after the onset terminated AS-activity. Measurement of interneuron numbers in different hippocampal subfields revealed that NPY+ interneurons were relatively resistant to AS activity in the aged hippocampus in comparison to the young adult hippocampus. Whereas  PV+ interneurons were highly susceptible to AS activity in both age groups. However  as aging alone substantially depleted these populations  the aged hippocampus after three-hours of AS activity exhibited 48% reductions in NPY+ interneurons and 70% reductions in PV+ interneurons  in comparison to the young hippocampus after similar AS activity. Thus  AS activity-induced TLE in old age is associated with far fewer hippocampal NPY+ and PV+ interneuron numbers than AS-induced TLE in the young adult age. This discrepancy likely underlies the severe spontaneous seizures and cognitive dysfunction observed in the aged people after AS activity."

Three-step liquid/liquid extraction with online derivatization (silylation) ahead of analysis by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated on rabbit specimens in order to quantify citalopram and 4 benzodiazepines (diazepam  nordazepam  oxazepam and temazepam) in 11 biological matrices (blood  urine  bile  vitreous humor  liver  kidney  skeletal muscle  brain  adipose tissue  bone marrow (BM) and lung). Since the 11 biological matrices came from the same animal species  full validation was performed on 1 matrix  bone marrow (considered the most complex)  while the other 10 underwent partial validation. Due to non-negligible matrix effects  calibration curves were performed on each matrix. Within-day and between-day precision (less than 12.0% and 12.6%  respectively) and accuracy (from 88.9% to 106.4%) were acceptable on BM at both low and high concentrations. Assessment on the other matrices confirmed accuracy and within-day precision (less than 12%  and generally between 85.1% and 114.5%  respectively). The lower limit of quantification of the method was 1ng/g for nordazepam  5ng/g for citalopram and 10ng/g for oxazepam  diazepam and temazepam. The combination of 3-step extraction and MS/MS detection provided good selectivity in all matrices  including the most lipid-rich. Application to real-case samples showed that the method was sensitive enough to describe distribution patterns in an animal experiment  and specific enough to detect molecules in highly putrefied samples from human postmortem cases."

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) function to promote neuronal plasticity  primarily through cleavage of extracellular matrix proteins. Here  we investigated the role of MMP-9 in the development of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindled seizure in mice. Repeated treatment with PTZ (40 mg/kg) produced kindled seizure  which was accompanied by enhanced MMP-9 activity and expression in the hippocampus. No change in MMP-9 activity was observed in the hippocampi of mice with generalized tonic seizure following single administration of PTZ (60 mg/kg). MMP-9 colocalized with the neuronal marker NeuN and the glial marker GFAP in the dentate gyrus of the kindled mouse hippocampus. Coadministration of diazepam or MK-801 with PTZ inhibited the development of kindling and the increased MMP-9 levels in the hippocampus. Marked suppression of kindled seizure progression in response to repeated PTZ treatment was observed in MMP-9((-/-)) mice compared with wild-type mice  an observation that was accompanied by decreased hippocampal levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Microinjecting the BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc into the right ventricle before each PTZ treatment significantly suppressed the development of kindling in wild-type mice  whereas no effect was observed in MMP-9((-/-)) mice. On the other hand  bilateral injections of pro-BDNF into the hippocampal dentate gyrus significantly enhanced kindling in wild-type mice but not MMP-9((-/-)) mice. These findings suggest that MMP-9 is involved in the progression of behavioral phenotypes in kindled mice because of conversion of pro-BDNF to mature BDNF in the hippocampus."

Thymoquinone (10 and 20 mg/kg)  methylene blue (1 mg/kg) and diazepam (2 mg/kg) were administered followed by behavioral testing using an elevated plus maze  the light/dark test and the social interaction test in both unstressed and stressed mice (mice subjected to 6 h immobilization). The effects of the above-mentioned drugs on plasma nitrite  a stable metabolite of nitric oxide (NO) and brain GABA content were also studied. Diazepam (2 mg/kg) produced significant anxiolytic-like effects only in unstressed mice. However  diazepam significantly increased the GABA content in both unstressed and stressed mice as compared with their respective control groups. Thymoquinone (10 and 20 mg/kg) produced significant antianxiety effects in unstressed mice without altering nitrite levels  but only the higher dose (20 mg/kg) of thymoquinone increased the GABA content in unstressed mice. In stressed mice  thymoquinone (20 mg/kg) showed anxiolytic effects  with a significant decrease in plasma nitrite and reversal of the decreased brain GABA content. Pre-treatment with methylene blue enhanced the antianxiety effect of thymoquinone in both unstressed and stressed mice. Therefore  the present study suggests an involvement of NO-cGMP and GABAergic pathways in the anxiolytic-like activity of thymoquinone."

Here  we have investigated aspects of hippocampal physiology in a proposed neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia  induced during gestation in rats by injection of the antimitotic agent methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) at embryonic day 17 (MAM(E17)). We observed a reduction in synaptic innervation and synaptic transmission in the dorsal hippocampus of MAM(E17) treated rats  accompanied by a pronounced increase in CA1 pyramidal neuron excitability. Pharmacological investigations suggested that a deficit in GABAergic inhibition could account for the increase in excitability; furthermore  some aspects of the hyper-excitability could be normalised by the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) potentiator diazepam. Despite these alterations  two major forms of synaptic plasticity  long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) could be readily induced. In contrast  there was a substantial deficit in the reversal of LTP  depotentiation. These findings suggest that delivering neurodevelopmental insults at E17 may offer insights into some of the physiological alterations that underlie behavioural and cognitive symptoms observed in schizophrenia."

Since there is evidence that Mg(2+) modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis  we tested whether enhanced anxiety-like behaviour can be reliably elicited by dietary Mg(2+) deficiency and whether Mg(2+) deficiency is associated with altered HPA axis function. Compared with controls  Mg(2+) deficient mice did indeed display enhanced anxiety-related behaviour in a battery of established anxiety tests. The enhanced anxiety-related behaviour of Mg(2+) deficient mice was sensitive to chronic desipramine treatment in the hyponeophagia test and to acute diazepam treatment in the open arm exposure test. Mg(2+) deficiency caused an increase in the transcription of the corticotropin releasing hormone in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN)  and elevated ACTH plasma levels  pointing to an enhanced set-point of the HPA axis. Chronic treatment with desipramine reversed the identified abnormalities of the stress axis. Functional mapping of neuronal activity using c-Fos revealed hyper-excitability in the PVN of anxious Mg(2+) deficient mice and its normalisation through diazepam treatment. Overall  the present findings demonstrate the robustness and validity of the Mg(2+) deficiency model as a mouse model of enhanced anxiety  showing sensitivity to treatment with anxiolytics and antidepressants. It is further suggested that dysregulations in the HPA axis may contribute to the hyper-emotionality in response to dietary induced hypomagnesaemia.

For 11 P-gp substrates  in vitro P-gp transport activities were determined by measuring transcellular transport across monolayers of mouse P-gp-transfected LLC-PK1 (L-mdr1a) and parental cells. P-gp expression amounts were determined by quantitative targeted absolute proteomics. Unbound drug fractions in plasma and brain were obtained from the literature and by measuring brain slice uptake  respectively. Brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (K(p brain)) and its ratios between wild-type and mdr1a/1b(-/-) mice (K(p brain) ratio) were obtained from the literature or determined by intravenous constant infusion. Unbound brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (K(p uu brain)) were estimated from K(p brain) and unbound fractions. Based on pharmacokinetic theory  K(p brain) ratios were reconstructed from in vitro P-gp transport activities and P-gp expression amounts in L-mdr1a cells and mouse brain capillaries. All reconstructed K(p brain) ratios were within a 1.6-fold range of observed values. K(p brain) then was reconstructed from the reconstructed K(p brain) ratios and unbound fractions. K(p uu brain) was reconstructed as the reciprocal of the reconstructed K(p brain) ratios. For quinidine  loperamide  risperidone  indinavir  dexamethasone  paclitaxel  verapamil  loratadine  and diazepam  the reconstructed K(p brain) and K(p uu brain) agreed with observed and estimated in vivo values within a 3-fold range  respectively.

"243","21820452","Susceptibility to the long-term anxiogenic effects of an acute stressor is mediated by the activation of the glucocorticoid receptors.","The specificity of the response of an organism is an important variable influencing stress-related parameters and psychopathological states. We have shown that trait anxiety in C57BL/6 mice  determined by their emergence latencies in the free choice open field test  positively correlates with the long-term behavioral and neuroendocrinological changes induced by a stressor. Here  we show that this interindividual variability is caused by a different reactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis upon exposure to a stressor. Mice with high trait anxiety (long emergence latency  LEL) display a more pronounced stress-induced activation of the HPA axis than mice with low trait anxiety (short emergence latency  SEL). Moreover  stress-induced activation of tyrosine hydroxylase and corticotropin-releasing hormone occurred in LEL but not SEL mice. In search of the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences  we found that under non-stressed conditions mRNA and protein levels of the glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus were higher in LEL mice compared to SEL mice. Also  systemic injection of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 decreased the stress-induced activation of the HPA axis and the long-term anxiogenic effects of stress observed in LEL mice. Finally  the rewarding properties of cocaine were enhanced in LEL mice compared to SEL mice  suggesting a causal link between trait anxiety  stress activity and the behavioral responses to drugs of addiction."
"244","21785864","The effect of baclofen and diazepam on motor skill acquisition in healthy subjects.","Antispastic medication is often used in the clinic together with physiotherapy. However  some of the antispastic drugs  e.g.  baclofen and diazepam  may influence the plastic mechanisms that are necessary for motor learning and hence efficient physiotherapy. In the present study  we consequently investigated the influence of baclofen and diazepam on acquisition of a visuomotor skill. The study was designed as a semi-randomized  double-blinded  placebo-controlled  crossover study in 16 healthy human subjects. The motor skill task required the subjects to match a given force trajectory by increasing or decreasing ankle dorsiflexor torque. Subjects trained for a total of 30 min. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex leg area was applied to elicit motor evoked potentials in the anterior tibial muscle (TA). Coupling between populations of TA motor units was calculated in the frequency (coherence) domain during isometric dorsiflexion. Subjects receiving placebo showed statistically significant improvement in motor performance (q = 34.1  P = 0.014) accompanied by a statistically significant reduction in intramuscular coherence. Subjects receiving baclofen and diazepam conversely showed no progression in motor performance (P &gt; 0.05)  and the training was not accompanied by a decrease in intramuscular coherence. TA motor evoked potentials had significantly lower threshold following the training in the placebo group  whereas this was not the case in the treatment groups. These data indicate that diazepam and baclofen interfere with the acquisition of a motor skill by disrupting some of the neuroplastic changes that are involved in improved motor performance. This suggests that antispastic treatment should be used with caution in subjects receiving concomitant physiotherapy."
"245","21777430","Transcriptional responses of the nerve agent-sensitive brain regions amygdala, hippocampus, piriform cortex, septum, and thalamus following exposure to the organophosphonate anticholinesterase sarin.","BACKGROUND: Although the acute toxicity of organophosphorus nerve agents is known to result from acetylcholinesterase inhibition  the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of neuropathology following nerve agent-induced seizure are not well understood. To help determine these pathways  we previously used microarray analysis to identify gene expression changes in the rat piriform cortex  a region of the rat brain sensitive to nerve agent exposure  over a 24-h time period following sarin-induced seizure. We found significant differences in gene expression profiles and identified secondary responses that potentially lead to brain injury and cell death. To advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in sarin-induced toxicity  we analyzed gene expression changes in four other areas of the rat brain known to be affected by nerve agent-induced seizure (amygdala  hippocampus  septum  and thalamus).METHODS: We compared the transcriptional response of these four brain regions to sarin-induced seizure with the response previously characterized in the piriform cortex. In this study  rats were challenged with 1.0 × LD50 sarin and subsequently treated with atropine sulfate  2-pyridine aldoxime methylchloride  and diazepam. The four brain regions were collected at 0.25  1  3  6  and 24 h after seizure onset  and total RNA was processed for microarray analysis.RESULTS: Principal component analysis identified brain region and time following seizure onset as major sources of variability within the dataset. Analysis of variance identified genes significantly changed following sarin-induced seizure  and gene ontology analysis identified biological pathways  functions  and networks of genes significantly affected by sarin-induced seizure over the 24-h time course. Many of the molecular functions and pathways identified as being most significant across all of the brain regions were indicative of an inflammatory response. There were also a number of molecular responses that were unique for each brain region  with the thalamus having the most distinct response to nerve agent-induced seizure.CONCLUSIONS: Identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in sarin-induced neurotoxicity in these sensitive brain regions will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics that can potentially provide broad-spectrum protection in five areas of the central nervous system known to be damaged by nerve agent-induced seizure."

However  despite this widely use  there are few controlled studies confirming its biological activity in central nervous system.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anxiolytic-like activity of the EO was investigated in light/dark box (LDB) and marble-burying test (MBT) and the antidepressant activity was investigated in forced-swimming test (FST) in mice. Flumazenil  a competitive antagonist of benzodiazepine binding and the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100635 was used in experimental procedures to determine the action mechanism of EO. To exclude any false positive results in experimental procedures  mice were submitted to the rota-rod test. We also quantified some neurotransmitters at specific brain regions after EO oral acute treatment.RESULTS: The present work found anxiolytic-like activity of the EO at the dose of 10mg/kg in a LDB. Flumazenil  but not WAY100635  was able to reverse the effect of the EO in the LDB  indicating that the EO activity occurs via the GABA(A) receptor-benzodiazepine complex. Only at higher doses did the EO potentiate diethyl-ether-induced sleeping time in mice. In the FST and MBT  EO showed no effect. Finally  the increase in time spent in the light chamber  demonstrated by concomitant treatment with ineffective doses of diazepam (DZP) and the EO  revealed a synergistic effect of the two compounds. The lack of activity after long-term treatment in the LDB test might be related to tolerance induction  even in the DZP-treated group. Furthermore  there were no significant differences between groups after either acute or repeated treatments with the EO in the rota-rod test. Neurochemical evaluation showed no amendments in neurotransmitter levels evaluated in cortex  striatum  pons  and hypothalamus.CONCLUSIONS: The results corroborate the use of Cymbopogon citratus in folk medicine and suggest that the anxiolytic-like effect of its EO is mediated by the GABA(A) receptor-benzodiazepine complex."

Recent studies have described their behaviors in a seminatural visible burrow system (VBS); a Social Proximity Test in which avoidance of a conspecific is impossible; and in an object approach and investigation test evaluating attention to specific objects and potential stereotypies in the order of approaching/investigating objects. VBS results confirmed strong BTBR avoidance of conspecifics and in the Social Proximity Test  BTBR showed dramatic differences in several close-in behaviors  including specific avoidance of a nose-to-nose contact that may potentially be related to gaze-avoidance. Diazepam normalized social avoidance by BTBRs in a Three-Chamber Test  and some additional behaviors - but not nose to nose avoidance - in the Social Proximity Test. BTBR also showed higher levels of preference for particular objects  and higher levels of sequences investigating 3- or 4-objects in the same order. Heparan sulfate (HS) associated with fractal structures in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles was severely reduced in BTBR. HS may modulate the functions of a range of growth and guidance factors during development  and HS abnormalities are associated with relevant brain (callosal agenesis) and behavioral (reductions in sociality) changes; suggesting the value of examination of the dynamics of the HS system in the context of autism."

Typically  brain insults produce morphological and functional alterations in the hippocampal formation  including neurodegeneration in CA1  CA3  and  most consistently  the dentate hilus. Most of these alterations develop gradually  over several days  after the insult  providing a therapeutic window of opportunity for neuroprotective agents in the immediate post-injury period. We have previously reported that prolonged (four weeks) treatment with the antiepileptic drug valproate (VPA) after SE prevents hippocampal damage and most of the behavioral alterations that occur after brain insult  but not the development of spontaneously occurring seizures. These data indicated that VPA  although not preventing epilepsy  might be an effective disease-modifying treatment following brain insult. The present study was designed to (1) determine the therapeutic window for the neuroprotective effect of VPA after SE; (2) compare the efficacy of different intermittent i.p. versus continuous i.v. VPA treatment protocols; and (3) compare VPA with the glutamate (AMPA) receptor antagonist NS1209. As in our previous study with VPA  SE was induced by sustained electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala in rats and terminated after 4 h by diazepam. In vehicle controls  &gt;90% of the animals developed significant neurodegeneration in the dentate hilus  whereas damage in CA1 and CA3 was more variable. Hilar parvalbumin-expressing interneurons were more sensitive to the effects of seizures than somatostatin-stained hilar interneurons or hilar mossy cells. Among the various VPA treatment protocols  continuous infusion of VPA for 24 immediately following the SE was the most effective neuroprotective treatment  preventing most of the neuronal damage. Infusion with NS1209 for 24 h exhibited similar neuroprotective efficacy. These data demonstrate that short treatment after SE with either VPA or NS1209 is powerfully neuroprotective  and may be disease-modifying treatments following brain insult."

In addition  the locomotor activity was measured at the end of the restraint period. Immobilization was induced to animals for 24 hr  and then  lipid peroxidation  superoxide dismutase activity and content  and mitochondrial function were all estimated in striatal tissue samples. Corticosterone levels were measured in serum. Diazepam was given to rats as a pre-treatment (1 mg/kg  i.p.) 20 min. before the initiation of stress. Our results indicate that acute stress produced enhanced striatal levels of lipid peroxidation (73% above the control)  decreased superoxide dismutase activity (54% below the control)  reduced levels of mitochondrial function (35% below the control) and increased corticosterone serum levels (86% above the control). Pre-treatment of stressed rats with diazepam decreased the striatal lipid peroxidation levels (68% below the stress group) and improved mitochondrial function (18% above the stress group)  but only mild preservation of superoxide dismutase activity was detected (17% above the stress group). In regard to the motor assessment  only the stereotyped activity was increased in the stress group with respect to control (46% above the control)  and this effect was prevented by diazepam administration (30% below the stress group). The preventive actions of diazepam in this acute model of stress suggest that drugs exhibiting anxiolytic and antioxidant properties might be useful for the design of therapies against early acute phases of physic stress."
"252","21643853","Effect of acute soman exposure on GABA(A) receptors in rat hippocampal slices and cultured hippocampal neurons.","Exposure of the central nervous system to organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents causes seizures and neuronal cell death. Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat seizures induced by OPs. However  it is known that soman-induced seizures are particularly resistant to benzodiazepine treatment  as compared with other OPs. This study investigated the effect of soman on <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in acute rat hippocampal slices and the surface expression of GABA(A) receptors in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Results showed that GABA-mediated inhibitory post synaptic currents (IPSCs) are significantly reduced by soman in a concentration-dependent manner in acute rat hippocampal slices. Furthermore  confocal microscopic and cell-based ELISA assays revealed that soman caused rapid internalization of GABA(A) receptors in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The effect of soman on GABA(A)R endocytosis was not due to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) because (1) the acetylcholine muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine did not block soman-induced GABA(A)R endocytosis; and (2) physostigmine  at concentrations that completely inhibit AChE activity  did not cause GABA(A)R endocytosis. Moreover  blocking of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) had no effect on soman-induced GABA(A)R endocytosis  suggesting that the soman effect was not secondary to glutamate receptor over activation. Regardless of the exact mechanism  the observation that soman induces rapid GABA(A)R endocytosis may have significant implications in the development of effective countermeasures against soman-induced seizures."

To manage the severity of SE  animals received diazepam 5min after the SE onset (acute group: 2.5 or 1.25mg/kg; i.p.; chronic group/; 1.25mg/kg; i.p). All animals were monitored by video and electrocorticography to assess SE and subsequent spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). To evaluate brain injury produced by SE or SRS we used argyrophil III  Nissl and neo-Timm staining techniques. Magnetic resonance image was also performed in the chronic group. We observed that pilocarpine was able to induce SE followed by SRS after a variable period of time. Prolonged SE episodes were associated with brain damage  mostly confined to the hippocampus and limbic structures. Similar to human TLE  anatomical disruption of dentate gyrus was observed after SRS.

This alteration of HPC activity was proposed to result from a reduction in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons and consequent destabilization of the output of pyramidal neurons  as well as disrupted activation across a broad neural network. In vivo extracellular recordings were performed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and ventral HPC of saline- (SAL) and MAM-treated animals. A novel benzodiazepine-positive allosteric modulator (PAM)  selective for the a5 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor  SH-053-2'F-R-CH3  was tested for its effects on the output of the HPC  leading to dopamine system hyperactivity in MAM-treated animals. In addition  the effect of SH-053-2'F-R-CH3 on the hyperactive locomotor response to amphetamine in MAM animals was examined. We demonstrate that treatment with the a5GABA(A)R PAM reduced the number of spontaneously active DA neurons in the VTA of MAM animals to levels observed in SAL rats  both when administered systemically and when directly infused into the ventral HPC. Moreover  HPC neurons in both SAL and MAM animals showed diminished cortical-evoked responses following a5GABA(A)R PAM treatment. In addition  the increased locomotor response to amphetamine observed in MAM rats was reduced following a5GABA(A)R treatment.

In a whole-body plethysmograph  respiratory responses to 5% CO2 were compared between d-opioid receptor knockout mice and wild-type mice after saline  diazepam (1mg/kg)  and alprazolam (0.3mg/kg) injections. The results show that lack of d-opioid receptors does not affect normal response to elevated CO2  but does prevent benzodiazepines from modulating that response. Thus  in the presence of benzodiazepine agonists  respiratory responses to elevated CO2 were enhanced in d-opioid receptor knockout mice compared to wild-type mice. This suggests an interplay between benzodiazepine receptors and d-opioid receptors in regulating the respiratory effects of elevated CO2  which might be related to CO2 induced panic."

Since the current pretreatment drug pyridostigmine fails in protecting brain-AChE  more effective pretreatment is necessary. A main focus of present-day pretreatment research is on bioscavengers  another is on centrally active reversible AChE-inhibitors combined with drugs showing anti-cholinergic  anti-glutamatergic  neuroprotective and non-sedating GABA-ergic activity. Strategies aimed at improving efficacy of pharmacological pretreatment will briefly be discussed. Galantamine  given as a pretreatment or stand-alone therapy  emerged as one of the best medical countermeasures against nerve agent poisoning in guinea pigs. Other preclinical studies demonstrated effective pretreatment consisting of physostigmine combined with procyclidine  scopolamine or bupropion (all single injections)  against nerve agent poisoning in guinea pigs. A long sign-free pretreatment with physostigmine (Alzet pump)  combined with single injection of procyclidine just before soman poisoning  enhanced the efficacy of a post-poisoning therapy consisting of 3 autoinjector equivalents of HI-6  atropine and diazepam  considerably."

The anaesthetic effect of propofol is thought to be mediated by <U+03B3>-amino butyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors. The present study investigated the effects on proteins important for normal neonatal brain development (i.e. BDNF  CaMKII  GAP-43  synaptophysin and tau)  and adult spontaneous motor and anxiety-like behaviours in response to diazepam  after neonatal exposure to propofol. Ten-day-old mice were exposed to 0  10 or 60 mg/kg bodyweight propofol. Neonatal propofol exposure changed the levels of BDNF in the brain  24h after exposure  but did not alter any of the other proteins. Neonatal propofol exposure significantly changed the adult response to the GABA-mimetic drug diazepam  manifest as no change in spontaneous motor activity and/or reduced sedative effect and an extinguished effect on the reduction of anxiety-like behaviours in an elevated plus maze. Although no adult spontaneous behavioural changes were detected after neonatal propofol exposure  the exposure caused an adult dose-dependent decrease in the response to the GABA-mimetic drug diazepam. These changes may be due to neonatal alterations in BDNF levels."

A 29-year-old man with mental retardation was admitted to our hospital because of high fever  muscle pain  and consciousness disturbance. Fifteen days before admission  he had developed muscle pain and weakness in his legs. He presented with fever  tachycardia  tachypnea  elevated blood pressure  excessive sweating  and neurological findings of lethargy and severe muscle rigidity in the neck and extremities. Laboratory findings included elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level. His clinical features and the laboratory test results fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for NMS. He was treated for NMS with dantrolene sodium and bromocriptine mesylate for 2 weeks; however  there was no improvement. Therefore  treatment was changed to diazepam administration because of suspected malignant catatonia. One week after initiation of diazepam administration  his symptoms gradually improved  and the serum CPK level normalized. The diagnosis of malignant catatonia was confirmed because treatment with diazepam was dramatically effective  whereas the initial treatment for NMS was not beneficial. The clinical presentation of malignant catatonia is similar to that of NMS. Indeed  some authors have described NMS as a variant of malignant catatonia. If treatment is refractory in cases of NMS  malignant catatonia may be suspected  and changing treatment to diazepam administration may be useful."

The various functional properties of Ammon's horn 1 (Cornu Amonis 1; CA1) area have been shown to rely on GABAergic and Glutamat- (Glu)-ergic neuronal signals during both postnatal and adult stages. For this purpose  it was the aim of the present study to establish whether certain alpha GABA(A)R subunits (alpha(2 5)) were capable of modifying CA1 structural and functional features via their interaction with specific NMDA receptor subunits such as NR1 during early development stages of the hibernating hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). Indeed  in vitro addition of the selective alpha(2 5) GABA(A)R agonist diazepam (DZP; alpha(2 5)) accounted for early neuronal formations that were blocked by its antagonist flumazenil (FLM). In particular  the former drug caused very great (p&lt;0.001) increases of dendritic sprouting and branching processes mainly at day in vitro (DIV) 3  while its effects still continued to be responsible for moderate (p&lt;0.05) increases of axonal length during the entire culture period. Contextually  DZP was also responsible for a very great up-regulated expression of neuritic NR1 and MAP2 together with a great (p&lt;0.01) increase of synaptophysin at DIV7. Overall  this first study suggests a specifically tight cross-talking relationship of GABAergic/Gluergic mechanisms operating during CA1 neuronal development  which may bring us closer to the identification of more selective therapeutic targets for hippocampal-linked neurological disorders."

A single treatment with 4-O-methylhonokiol (0.1  0.2  and 0.5 mg/kg  p.o.) or treatment for 7 days (0.5 mg/kg in drinking water) increased the percentage of time spent in the open arms and the number of open arms entries in the elevated plus-maze test. However  the 4-O-methylhonokiol-increased percentage of time spent in the open arm was abolished by treatment with flumazenil  a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (10 mg/kg). 4-O-Methylhonokiol also increased the number of head dips in the hole-board test  but decreased locomotor activity. Molecular experiments revealed that the a1-subunit of <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors was overexpressed in the cortex of brains of mice after treatment with 4-O-methylhonokiol for 7 days. In addition  4-O-methylhonokiol also increased chloride influx in cultured cortical cells. It is concluded that 4-O-methylhonokiol may have anxiolytic-like effects and that these effects may be mediated by GABAergic transmission with the increase of Cl(-) channel opening."

GSH decreased in A  B and C groups. 5-HT increased in group A and the prostate weight was increased in group E. The conclusion is that 16ß-methyl-17a-benzoyloxypregnen-4-en-3 20-dione may be considered novel and promising to treat androgen-dependent diseases and epilepsy  since it showed an antioxidant effect and seemed to impair the GABAergic and serotonergic metabolism."

However  little is known on the impact of physiological ketosis on brain excitability. We addressed this question in suckling rats in vivo. 16-channel extracellular field potential recordings were performed from somatosensory barrel cortex at postnatal days 5-9 non-anaesthetized rat pups. Seizures were induced by the volatile convulsant agent flurothyl. One hour after blockade of physiological ketogenesis using combined administration of beta-oxidation inhibitors mercaptoacetate  insulin and glucose to prevent hypoglycemia  we found no significant change in the flurothyl-induced electrographic seizures. However  build-up of seizures during two repetitive flurothyl applications was strongly aggravated in the animals with blocked ketogenesis. The effect of ketogenesis inhibitors was reversed by exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate. Diazepam exerted anticonvulsive action both under physiological ketosis and after blockade of ketogenesis  and bumetanide had no significant anticonvulsive effects in both conditions. Thus  physiological ketosis reduces excitability in the immature brain and elimination of physiological ketosis results in elimination of this anticonvulsant effect. Our study raises concern that the changes in diet  and pharmacological manipulations such as glucose infusion  and pathologies such as hyperinsulinism which break natural ketosis  may be a potential risk factor for epileptogenesis in nursing infants."

This technique therefore allows a direct functional characterization of the original membrane receptor/ion channel proteins and the associated molecules while still embedded in their natural lipid environment. Cell membranes will contain components from different types of cells  i.e. neurons and glial cells  expressing their own receptors  with possibly different properties. To study the receptor properties of a single cell type  we injected oocytes with membranes isolated only from glia (gliosomes) of adult mouse neocortex and we focused our work on GABA(A) receptors incorporated in the oocyte cell membrane. We found that GABA(A)-activated currents allowed a good biophysical and pharmacological characterization of glial GABA(A) receptors. Therefore  the microtransplantation of gliosomes into oocytes can represent a good model to study the electrical and pharmacological properties of adult glial cells under different physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover  since gliosomes can be isolated from frozen tissues  this approach can be extended to post-mortem human tissues."

In recent experiments  intracerebroventricular (ICV) SST produced anxiolytic-like effects in both behavioral and electrophysiological models. The sites of action of these anxiolytic effects in the brain  however  and the relative contributions of SST 14 and SST 28 to these effects are unknown.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anxiolytic effects were assessed in the plus-maze and shock-probe tests after (1) intra-amygdalar microinfusion of SST 14 (0.5 or 3 µg per hemisphere) or SST 28 (3 µg per hemisphere)  (2) intra-septal microinfusion of SST 14 (0.5 or 1.5 µg per hemisphere) or SST 28 (1.5 µg per hemisphere)  or (3) intra-striatal microinfusion of SST 14 (3 µg per hemisphere).RESULTS: Intra-amygdalar and intra-septal microinfusions of SST 14 and SST 28 produced robust anxiolytic-like effects in the behavioral tests  unlike intra-striatal microinfusions. The magnitude of the anxiolytic effects in the amygdala and septum were comparable to those found previously with ICV SST 14  ICV L-779976  an SST (sst2) receptor agonist  and ICV diazepam  a classical benzodiazepine anxiolytic.CONCLUSIONS: SST receptors in the septum and amygdala are responsive to both SST 14 and SST 28  but not those in the striatum. Although no obvious differences in the anxiolytic-like effects of the isoforms were detected  quantitative or even qualitative differences in their specific anxiolytic effects may occur in different sub-regions of the septum and amygdala  as has been found for benzodiazepine anxiolytics."

However  because only few animal models display overt anxious-like behavior  detailed preclinical studies of the anxiolytic properties of antidepressants are still lacking. Here  we studied the neurochemical and behavioral effects of a double 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor knockout in mice (5-HT(1A/1B)-/-) as compared to their wild-type littermates (5-HT(1A/1B)+/+). It is known that single deletion of either 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(1B) receptor induces behavioral changes that are not correlated with differences in brain serotonergic tone. Deletion of both receptors resulted in (i) higher emotionality of animals  as observed in three unconditioned paradigms of anxiety (open field  elevated plus maze and novelty suppressed feeding tests); (ii) a 200% increase in the mean spontaneous firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) compared to 5-HT(1A/1B)+/+ mice; (iii) elevated basal dialysate levels of 5-HT in the DRN and frontal cortex; (iv) an exaggerated response to acute paroxetine administration in microdialysis experiments  and (v) increased basal core body temperature. These findings suggest that the deletion of both autoreceptors induces a strong anxious-like behavioral state associated with increased 5-HT neurotransmission. Interestingly  5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mice are still sensitive to the acute administration of diazepam. Moreover  while deletion of both receptors impacted on the response to acute SSRI treatment in the forced swim test  anxiolytic-like effects of a chronic SSRI treatment were still observed in 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mice. Thus  the 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mouse model could be of great interest to unveil the mechanisms of action of the anxiolytic effects of SSRIs."

The L-fructose moiety was obtained by using a new synthetic pathway starting from L-arabinose through a six steps synthesis in 18% overall yield. Molecular modeling calculations and DNMR studies showed that D- and L-fructose-based pyrrolobenzodiazepines exhibit a rigid (P)- and (M)-helical conformation  respectively  in which the C-11a substituent was always pseudoequatorial. Additionally  pyrrolobenzodiazepines functionalized with a chloride  bromide  nitro  or amino group in the benzene ring  with or without N-methylation and with or without protection of sugar alcohol groups  allowed a relationship between the molecular structure and biological activity to be established. The conformation of the diazepam ring was not the sole key player influencing binding affinities  and the sugar moiety can in some cases increase the binding activity  possibly by participating in the binding event. Finally  these compounds have increased the understanding of the differential recognition of (M)-/(P)-helical benzodiazepines on GABA(A) receptor."

Granule cell axon (mossy fiber) sprouting is a common neuropathological finding in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy  but its role in epileptogenesis is unclear and controversial. Focally infused or systemic rapamycin inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and suppresses mossy fiber sprouting in rats. We tested whether long-term systemic treatment with rapamycin  beginning 1 d after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in mice  would suppress mossy fiber sprouting and affect the development of spontaneous seizures. Mice that had experienced status epilepticus and were treated for 2 months with rapamycin displayed significantly less mossy fiber sprouting (42% of vehicle-treated animals)  and the effect was dose dependent. However  behavioral and video/EEG monitoring revealed that rapamycin- and vehicle-treated mice displayed spontaneous seizures at similar frequencies. These findings suggest mossy fiber sprouting is neither pro- nor anti-convulsant; however  there are caveats. Rapamycin treatment also reduced epilepsy-related hypertrophy of the dentate gyrus but did not significantly affect granule cell proliferation  hilar neuron loss  or generation of ectopic granule cells. These findings are consistent with the hypotheses that hilar neuron loss and ectopic granule cells might contribute to temporal lobe epileptogenesis."

It is an evolutionarily well-conserved protein particularly located at the outer/inner mitochondrial membrane contact sites  in closely association with the 32 kDa voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and the 30 kDa adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT)  thus forming the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). TSPO is ubiquitary expressed in peripheral tissues (steroid producing tissues  liver  heart  kidney  lung  immune system) and in lower levels in the central nervous system  where it is mainly located in glial cells  and in neurons. TSPO is involved in a variety of biological processes such as cholesterol transport  steroidogenesis  calcium homeostasis  lipid metabolism  mitochondrial oxidation  cell growth and differentiation  apoptosis induction  and regulation of immune functions. In the last decade  many studies have reported that TSPO basal expression is altered in a number of human pathologies  such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases)  as well as in various forms of brain injury and inflammation and anxiety. Consequently  TSPO has not only been suggested as a promising drug target for a number of therapeutic applications (anticonvulsant  anxiolytic  immunomodulating  etc.)  but also as valid diagnostic marker for related-disease state and progression  prompting the development of specific labelled ligands as powerful tools for imaging techniques. A number of structurally different classes of ligands have been reported  showing high affinity and selectivity towards TSPO. Indeed  most of these ligands have been designed starting from selective CBR ligands which were structurally modified in order to shift their affinity towards TSPO. Extensive structure-activity relationship studies were performed allowing to hypothesize various TSPO pharmacophore models. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the structural requirements needed to obtain TSPO ligands with high affinity and selectivity."

The GP is composed of a network of inhibitory GABA-containing projection neurons which receive GABAergic input from axons of the striatum (Str) and local collaterals of GP neurons. Here  using electrophysiological techniques and immunofluorescent labeling we have investigated the differential cellular distribution of a1  a2 and a3 GABA(A) receptor subunits in relation to striatopallidal (Str-GP) and pallidopallidal (GP-GP) synapses. Electrophysiological investigations showed that zolpidem (100 nm; selective for the a1 subunit) increased the amplitude and the decay time of both Str-GP and GP-GP IPSCs  indicating the presence of the a1 subunits at both synapses. However  the application of drugs selective for the a2  a3 and a5 subunits (zolpidem at 400 nm  L-838 417 and TP003) revealed differential effects on amplitude and decay time of IPSCs  suggesting the nonuniform distribution of non-a1 subunits. Immunofluorescence revealed widespread distribution of the a1 subunit at both soma and dendrites  while double- and triple-immunofluorescent labeling for parvalbumin  enkephalin  gephyrin and the <U+03B3>2 subunit indicated strong immunoreactivity for GABA(A) a3 subunits in perisomatic synapses  a region mainly targeted by local axon collaterals. In contrast  immunoreactivity for synaptic GABA(A) a2 subunits was observed in dendritic compartments where striatal synapses are preferentially located. Due to the kinetic properties which each GABA(A) a subunit confers  this distribution is likely to contribute differentially to both physiological and pathological patterns of activity."

The fact that they are more common  diverse and perceived as embedded in normal life may explain this relative oversight. In addition  as for other psychiatric disorders  there are technical challenges related to the identification and validation of candidate genes and peripheral biomarkers. Human studies  particularly genetic ones  are susceptible to the issue of being underpowered  because of genetic heterogeneity  the effect of variable environmental exposure on gene expression  and difficulty of accrual of large  well phenotyped cohorts. Animal model gene expression studies  in a genetically homogeneous and experimentally tractable setting  can avoid artifacts and provide sensitivity of detection. Subsequent translational integration of the animal model datasets with human genetic and gene expression datasets can ensure cross-validatory power and specificity for illness. We have used a pharmacogenomic mouse model (involving treatments with an anxiogenic drug--yohimbine  and an anti-anxiety drug--diazepam) as a discovery engine for identification of anxiety candidate genes as well as potential blood biomarkers. Gene expression changes in key brain regions for anxiety (prefrontal cortex  amygdala and hippocampus) and blood were analyzed using a convergent functional genomics (CFG) approach  which integrates our new data with published human and animal model data  as a translational strategy of cross-matching and prioritizing findings. Our work identifies top candidate genes (such as FOS  GABBR1  NR4A2  DRD1  ADORA2A  QKI  RGS2  PTGDS  HSPA1B  DYNLL2  CCKBR and DBP)  brain-blood biomarkers (such as FOS  QKI and HSPA1B)  pathways (such as cAMP signaling) and mechanisms for anxiety disorders--notably signal transduction and reactivity to environment  with a prominent role for the hippocampus. Overall  this work complements our previous similar work (on bipolar mood disorders and schizophrenia) conducted over the last decade. It concludes our programmatic first pass mapping of the genomic landscape of the triad of major psychiatric disorder domains using CFG  and permitted us to uncover the significant genetic overlap between anxiety and these other major psychiatric disorders  notably the under-appreciated overlap with schizophrenia.

As a free radical  NO may cause oxidative stress  which is emerging as an important mechanism in the etiology of seizure-induced neuronal death. Here we investigated the role of NO in seizure mechanisms through oxidative stress generation by studying the effect of anticonvulsant drugs such as amino oxyacetic acid (AAOA)  valproate (VALP)  diazepam (DIAZ) and gabapentin (GBPTNA) on oxidative stress in the brain  estimated as free carbonyls by the method of Dalle and Rossi  and by measuring NO by the indirect method based on the Griess reaction. Results show that  except for AAOA and VALP  anticonvulsants did not significantly affect or decreased free carbonyls  but reversed the oxidative stress produced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced convulsions. Anticonvulsants except AAOA diminished NO levels and with the exception of VALP  counteracted the increase in NO generated by PTZ. Anticonvulsants decreased oxidative stress and NO especially in hippocampus (HI) and cortex (CX)  and reversed PTZ effects on both parameters. PTZ diminished NO in HI  which could be explained since PTZ caused an increase on endothelial NO synthase but a decrease in neuronal NOS expression in this brain area. Since the drugs studied are modulating GABA levels  our results suggest that seizures generated by alterations in GABAergic transmission produce oxidative stress caused by NO  which can be reversed by anticonvulsants. The effects described differ among the brain regions studied and the NO synthase isoform affected."

As a mechanistic approach  we looked at the role of the cannabinergic system which is linked to depression and/or antidepressant effect and appears to interact with neurotrophin signaling.METHODS: Following psychotropic treatment  NGF or endocannabinoid (eCB) contents were quantified by Bio-Rad protein assay and isotope-dilution liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry  respectively. In case of any significant change  the effects of pretreatment with the CB(1) receptor neutral antagonist AM4113 were investigated.RESULTS: Single injection of nortriptyline  isocarboxazid  citalopram  diazepam  risperidone (2.5  5  and 10 mg/kg  each)  and fluphenazine (0.25  0.5  and 1 mg/kg) into rats did not alter NGF or eCB contents. Following 4-week treatment  all drugs except diazepam elevated NGF or eCB levels in dose-dependent and brain region-specific fashion. Pretreatment with the highest dose of AM4113 (5.6 mg/kg) prevented psychotropic-induced NGF or eCB elevation. AM4113 had no effect by itself.CONCLUSIONS: The cannabinergic system is implicated in the mechanisms of action of certain psychotropic drugs including the upregulation of brain NGF levels. This provides a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders  leading to novel drug design."

The cerebellar GABAA receptor (GABAAR) a6 subunit alleles a6-100R and a6-100Q are segregated in the AT and ANT rats  respectively. This a6 polymorphism might explain various differences in pharmacological properties and density of GABAARs between the rat lines. In the present study  we have used nonselected outbred Sprague-Dawley rats homozygous for the a6-100RR (RR) and a6-100QQ (QQ) genotypes to show that these RR and QQ rats display similar differences between genotypes as AT and ANT rat lines. The genotypes differed in their affinity for [3H]Ro 15-4513 and classic benzodiazepines (BZs) to cerebellar &quot;diazepam-insensitive&quot; (DZ-IS) binding sites  in density of cerebellar [3H]muscimol binding and in the antagonizing effect of furosemide on GABA-induced inhibition of [3H]EBOB binding. The results suggest the involvement of a6-R100Q polymorphism in these line differences and in the differences previously found between AT and ANT rats. In addition  the a6-R100Q polymorphism induces striking differences in [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding kinetics to recombinant a6ß3<U+03B3>2s receptors and cerebellar DZ-IS sites. Association of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding was ~10-fold faster and dissociation was ~3-4-fold faster in DZ-IS a6ß<U+03B3>2 receptors containing the a6-100Q allele  with a resulting change of ~2.5-fold in equilibrium dissociation constant (KD).

However  psychomimetic and memory disruptive side effects  as well as the potential for abuse and dependence  have restricted their clinical development. Endogenous cannabinoids (i.e.  endocannabinoids; eCBs)  such as anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)  are produced throughout the limbic system and other brain regions associated with emotionality and are believed to modulate behavioral responses to stress-related conditions. AEA and 2-AG are rapidly metabolized by the respective enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). Accordingly  inhibition of each enzyme increases brain levels of the appropriate eCB. Although FAAH inhibition has been established to decrease anxiety-like behavior  the role of 2-AG has been difficult to ascertain until the recent synthesis of JZL184  a potent and selective MAGL inhibitor. In the present study  we investigated the effects of inhibiting FAAH or MAGL on anxiety-like behavior in marble burying  a model of repetitive  compulsive behaviors germane to anxiety disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. The FAAH inhibitor PF-3845  the MAGL inhibitor JZL184  and the benzodiazepine diazepam decreased marble burying at doses that did not affect locomotor activity. In contrast  <U+0394>9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  the primary psychoactive constituent of marijuana  did not consistently reduce marble burying without also eliciting profound decreases in locomotor behavior. The CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist rimonabant blocked the reduction in marble burying caused by FAAH and MAGL inhibitors  but not by diazepam  indicating a CB1 receptor mechanism of action. These data indicate that elevation of AEA or 2-AG reduces marble burying behavior and suggest that their catabolic enzymes represent potential targets for the development of new classes of pharmacotherapeutics to treat anxiety-related disorders."

We previously reported that trans-6 4'-dimethoxyretrochalcone (Rc-OMe)  a hydrolytic derivative of the corresponding flavylium salt  displayed nanomolar affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A)Rs. Here  we evaluate the functional modulations of Rc-OMe  along with two other synthetic derivatives trans-6-bromo-4'-methoxyretrochalcone (Rc-Br) and 4 3'-dimethoxychalcone (Ch-OMe) on GABA(A)Rs.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made to determine the effects of these derivatives on GABA(A)Rs expressed in HEK-293 cells and in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal and thalamic neurones from rat brain.KEY RESULTS: Rc-OMe strongly potentiated GABA-evoked currents at recombinant a(1-4)ß(2)<U+03B3>(2s) and a(4)ß(3)d receptors but much less at a(1)ß(2) and a(4)ß(3). Rc-Br and Ch-OMe potentiated GABA-evoked currents at a(1)ß(2)<U+03B3>(2s). The potentiation by Rc-OMe was only reduced at a(1)H101Rß(2)<U+03B3>(2s) and a(1)ß(2)N265S<U+03B3>(2s)  mutations known to abolish the potentiation by diazepam and loreclezole respectively. The modulation of Rc-OMe and pentobarbital as well as by Rc-OMe and the neurosteroid 3a 21-dihydroxy-5a-pregnan-20-one was supra-additive. Rc-OMe modulation exhibited no apparent voltage-dependence  but was markedly dependent on GABA concentration. In neurones  Rc-Br slowed the decay of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents and both Rc-OMe and Rc-Br positively modulated synaptic and extrasynaptic diazepam-insensitive GABA(A)Rs.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The trans-retrochalcones are powerful positive allosteric modulators of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs. These novel modulators act through an original mode  thus making them putative drug candidates in the treatment of GABA(A)-related disorders in vivo."

In a search for safer and more effective anticonvulsant BZs against OP-induced seizure and neuronal damage  we have previously shown that imidazenil (IMD)  a low-intrinsic efficacy positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) action at a1-containing GABA(A) receptors  which has high intrinsic efficacy at a2-  a3-  and a5-containing GABA(A) receptors  is more potent and longer lasting than DZ pretreatment at protecting rats from diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP)-induced electrocorticographic (ECoG) seizures and neuronal damage. The effects of IMD were observed at doses that are devoid of sedative  amnestic  and anticonvulsant tolerance actions. In the present study  we compared the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects of a combination of atropine (2 mg/kg  ip) and pyridine-2-aldoxime methochloride (2-PAM  20 mg/kg  ip) with IMD (0.5 mg/kg  ip) or midazolam (MDZ  0.5-2 mg/kg  ip) administered after the onset of DFP (1.5 mg/kg  sc)-induced seizure activity. The severity of DFP-induced ECoG seizures was assessed by continuous radio telemetry recordings in unrestrained and freely moving rats. Furthermore  the extent of neuronal damage was evaluated using a neuron-specific nuclear protein immunolabeling and fluoro-jade B staining procedure. We report here that IMD is more efficacious and longer lasting than sedating doses of MDZ in protecting rats from DFP-induced ECoG seizures and neuronal damage."

It was identified by the induction of DeltaFosB following chronic cocaine exposure. In this work  we screened 20 drugs for their ability to induce FosB/DeltaFosB in the tVTA.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Immunohistochemistry following systemic drug administration was used to study FosB/DeltaFosB induction in the tVTA of adult rats. Double-staining was used to determine whether dopamine or GABA neurones are involved in this induction.KEY RESULTS: The acute injection of the psychostimulant drugs cocaine  D-amphetamine  (+/-)-3 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)  methylphenidate or caffeine  induced the expression of FosB/DeltaFosB in the tVTA GABAergic cells. No induction was observed following exposure to ethanol  diazepam  <U+03B3>-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB)  morphine  ketamine  phencyclidine (PCP)  <U+0394>(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  sodium valproic acid or gabapentin. To evaluate the role of monoamine transporters in the psychostimulant-induced expression of FosB/DeltaFosB  we tested the antidepressant drugs reboxetine  nortriptyline  fluoxetine and venlafaxine (which target the noradrenaline and/or the 5-hydroxytryptamine transporters)  the 5-hydroxytryptamine releasing agent dexfenfluramine  and the dopamine transporter inhibitor GBR12909. Only GBR12909 was able to induce FosB/DeltaFosB expression in the tVTA  showing that this induction is mediated by dopamine.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Newly described brain structures may help to increase our knowledge of brain function  pathology and targets for treatments. FosB/DeltaFosB induction in the tVTA is a common feature of drugs sharing psychostimulant properties but not of drugs sharing risk of abuse."

In this way  the study of animals that naturally present low PPI responses could be a useful approach for screening new antipsychotic drugs. Several pieces of evidence suggest that dopamine and nitric oxide (NO) can modulate PPI but their role in those animals is unknown.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of dopamine and NO in Wistar rats with naturally low PPI response.METHODS: Male Wistar rats with low PPI responses received an i.p. injection of the antipsychotics haloperidol (0.1  0.3 or 1mg/kg) or clozapine (0.5  1.5 or 5mg/kg)  the anxiolytic diazepam (1 or 3mg/kg) or the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors  N(G)- nitro-l-arginine (l-NOARG; 40mg/kg  acutely or sub-chronically) or 7-Nitroindazole (7-NI; 3  10 or 30mg/kg). All animals were submitted to the PPI test 1h after injection. Striatal and cortical dopamine  DOPAC  and noradrenaline levels of rats with low PPI responses were compared to rats with normal PPI responses.RESULTS: We found increased levels of catecholamines on the striatum and prefrontal cortex of Wistar rats with low PPI. In these animals  both antipsychotics  typical and atypical  and NOS inhibitors significantly increased PPI.CONCLUSION: Taken together  our findings suggest that the low PPI phenotype may be driven by an overactive catecholamine system. Additionally  our results corroborate the hypothesis of dopamine and NO interaction on PPI modulation and suggest that Wistar rats with low PPI may represent an interesting non-pharmacological model to evaluate new potential antipsychotics."
"280","21050171","GABAA receptor subtype-selective modulators. II. a5-selective inverse agonists for cognition enhancement.","Benzodiazepine site agonists (such as diazepam) are well-known to impair cognition. Since benzodiazepines exert their effects via modulation of a1-  a2-  a3- and a5-containing GABA(A) receptors  the cognition-impairing effects of diazepam must be associated with one or several of these subtypes. Of these different subtypes  a5-containing GABA(A) receptors represent an attractive option as the &quot;cognition&quot; subtype based upon the preferential localization of these receptors within the hippocampus and the well-established role of the hippocampus in learning and memory. As a result  it is hypothesized that an inverse agonist selective for the a5 subtype should enhance cognition. For example  L-655708  a partial inverse agonist with 50-100-fold higher affinity for the a5 relative to the a1  a2 and a3 subtypes of GABA(A) receptors  enhanced cognitive performance in rats. Unfortunately  however  pharmacokinetic properties of this compound prevented it being developed further. In order to try achieve binding selectivity in a series structurally distinct from the imidazobenzodiazepines  the group at Merck  Sharp &amp; Dohme commenced studies within the triazolopyridazine series. Although a degree of binding selectivity could be achieved (a maximum of 22-125-fold for a5 versus a1  a2 or a3) this approach was dropped in favour of a strategy to identify compounds with either a combination of selective affinity and selective efficacy or purely selective efficacy. With respect to the former  screening of the Merck chemical collection identified a novel  moderately a5-binding selective thiophene series and further optimization of this series produced MRK-536  which demonstrated a modest a5 binding selectivity (~10-fold) as well as a5-efficacy selectivity. However  the structure-activity relationship within this and the analogous tetralone series proved unpredictable and these series were not pursued further. The success of the selective efficacy approach on the a2/a3-selective agonist project led a similar paradigm being adopted for the a5 project. The starting point for this strategy was the triazolopyridazine 3 which  like MRK-536  possessed a degree of both a5 binding- and efficacy-selectivity. By changing the core from a triazolopyridazine to a triazolophthalazine structure  a5 binding selectivity was lost but with subsequent optimization  compounds with the desired profile (low or antagonist efficacy at the a1  a2 and a3 subtypes and marked inverse agonism at a5-containing receptors) could be achieved  allowing the clinical candidate a5IA as well as the structurally-related pharmacological tool compound a5IA-II to be identified. By appending features of the prototypic a2/a3-selective triazolopyridazine L-838417 (t-butyl and 1 2 4 triazole) along with the isoxazole of a5IA to a pyrazolotriazine core  an additional clinical candidate  MRK-016  was identified. Finally  a degree of a5 efficacy selectivity was achieved the pyridazine series but metabolic instability within this chemotype limited its further optimization. Overall  these studies demonstrate the feasibility of adopting a selective efficacy approach in the identification of a5 selective GABA(A) receptor inverse agonists."

A new pH-dependent CRE was derived and applied to remove the hydrodynamic component of effective permeability  P(e)  to produce P(c) values.RESULTS: It was shown by the analysis of the in situ data in the pH 6.5-8.5 interval for the lipophilic bases that the average vascular flow F(pf)<U+2009>= 0.036 mL·g(-1)·s(-1)  centered in a &quot;flow-limit window&quot; (FLW) bounded by P (e) (min) <U+2009>= 170 and P (e) (max) <U+2009>= 776 (10(-6) cm·s(-1) units). It was shown that the traditional CRE is expected not to work for half of the molecules in the FLW and is expected to underestimate (up to 64-fold) the other half of the molecules.CONCLUSION: The new pH-CRE flow correction method applied to lipophilic ionizable drugs  based on the pH partition hypothesis  can overcome the limitations of the traditional CRE."
"282","20981413","Cellular correlates of anxiety in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells of 5-HT1A receptor knockout mice.","RATIONALE: 5-HT(1A) receptor knockout (1AKO) mice have a robust anxiety phenotype. Tissue-specific &quot;rescue&quot; strategies and electrophysiology have implicated a critical role for postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors  particularly in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.OBJECTIVES: In this study  we evaluated differences in membrane properties and synaptic activity in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells between 1AKOs and wild-type (WT) controls to better understand the cellular correlates of anxiety in this mouse model.METHODS: Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were conducted in CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal brain slices from 1AKOs and WTs that had previously been screened for anxiety with the elevated-plus maze. Spontaneous miniature inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs and EPSCs) and stimulus-evoked eIPSCs and eEPSCs were recorded in addition to the effect of the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam or the inverse agonist FG 7142 on <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic eIPSCs.RESULTS: Evoked EPSC amplitude was greater in 1AKOs than WTs. When subjects were pooled across genotypes  anxiety measures correlated with eEPSC amplitude  indicating enhanced postsynaptic glutamate synaptic activity under conditions of synaptic activation in anxious subjects. While GABA synaptic activity and sensitivity to diazepam were not affected by genotype or correlated with anxiety  sensitivity to the anxiogenic FG 7142 was smaller in anxious subjects.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate enhanced postsynaptic glutamate receptor sensitivity and decreased GABAergic inhibition by a benzodiazepine inverse agonist in CA1 hippocampal neurons of anxious mice are produced by deletion of the 5-HT(1A) receptor. These data provide new information about interactions between 5-HT  GABA  and glutamate systems during the expression of chronic anxiety."

How synaptic activity relates to Aß accumulation and loss of synapses is a current topic of major interest. Synaptic activation promotes Aß secretion  and chronic reduction of synaptic activity reduced Aß plaques in an AD transgenic mouse model. This suggested beneficial effects of reducing synaptic activity in AD. We now show that reduced synaptic activity causes detrimental effects on synapses and memory despite reducing plaques using two different models of chronic synaptic inhibition: deafferentation of the barrel cortex and administration of benzodiazepine. An interval of prolonged synaptic inhibition exacerbated loss of synaptophysin compared with synaptically more active brain in AD transgenic but not wild-type mice. Furthermore  an interval of benzodiazepine treatment  followed by a washout period  exacerbated memory impairment in AD transgenic mice. Exacerbation of synaptic and behavioral abnormalities occurred in the setting of reduced Aß plaques but elevated intraneuronal Aß immunoreactivity. These data support beneficial effects of synaptic activation on Aß-related synaptic and behavioral impairment in AD."

Many neuropeptides require amidation for full activation by peptidylglycine a-amidating monooxygenase (PAM)  a transmembrane vesicular cuproenzyme and regulator of the secretory pathway. Mice heterozygous for the Pam gene (PAM(+/-)) exhibit physiological and behavioral abnormalities related to specific peptidergic pathways. In the present study  we evaluated emotionality and examined molecular and cellular responses that characterize neurophysiological differences in the PAM(+/-) amygdala. PAM(+/-) mice presented with anxiety-like behaviors in the zero maze that were alleviated by diazepam. PAM(+/-) animals were deficient in short- and long-term contextual and cued fear conditioning and required higher shock intensities to establish fear-potentiated startle than their wild-type littermates. Immunohistochemical analysis of the amygdala revealed PAM expression in pyramidal neurons and local interneurons that synthesize GABA. We performed whole-cell recordings of pyramidal neurons in the PAM(+/-) amygdala to elucidate neurophysiological correlates of the fear behavioral phenotypes. Consistent with these observations  thalamic afferent synapses in the PAM(+/-) lateral nucleus were deficient in long-term potentiation. This deficit was apparent in the absence and presence of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin and was abolished when both GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors were blocked. Both evoked and spontaneous excitatory signals were enhanced in the PAM(+/-) lateral nucleus. Phasic GABAergic signaling was also augmented in the PAM(+/-) amygdala  and this difference comprised activity-independent and -dependent components. These physiological findings represent perturbations in the PAM(+/-) amygdala that may underlie the aberrant emotional responses in the intact animal."

The role of the central nucleus of the IC (CIC) on fear and anxiety has been suggested on the basis that rats are able to engage in tasks to decrease the aversiveness of CIC stimulation  increased Fos immunolabeling during diverse aversive states and increased CIC auditory evoked potentials (AEP) induced by conditioned fear stimuli. Additionally  it was shown that brainstem AEP  represented by wave V  for which the main generator is the IC  is increased during experimentally-induced anxiety. Rats segregated according to their low or high emotional reactivity have been used as an important tool in the study of fear and anxiety. The IC contains a high density of GABA receptors. Since the efficacy of an anxiolytic compound is a function of the animal's anxiety level  it is possible that GABA-benzodiazepine (Bzp) agents affect LA and HA animals differently. In this study we investigated the GABA-Bzp influence on the modulation of AEP in rats with low- (LA) or high-anxiety (HA) levels  as assessed by the elevated plus-maze test (EPM). GABA-Bzp modulation on the unconditioned AEP response was analyzed by using intra-CIC injections (0.2 µl) of the GABA-Bzp agonists muscimol (121 ng) and diazepam (30 µg)  or the GABA inhibitors bicuculline (10 ng) and semicarbazide (7 µg). In a second experiment  we evaluate the effects of contextual aversive conditioning on AEP using foot-shocks as unconditioned stimuli. On the unconditioned fear paradigm GABA inhibition increased AEP in LA rats and decreases this measure in HA counterparts. Muscimol was effective in reducing AEP in both LA and HA rats. Contextual fear stimuli increased the magnitude of AEP. In spite of no effect obtained with diazepam in LA rats the drug inhibited AEP in HA animals. The specificity of the regulatory mechanisms mediated by GABA-Bzp for the ascending neurocircuits responsible for the acquisition of aversive information in LA and HA animals shed light on the processing of sensory information underlying the generation of defensive reactions."
"286","20889946","Diazepam decreases action potential firing of neocortical neurons via two distinct mechanisms.","BACKGROUND: Benzodiazepines are widely used in clinical anesthesia as premedication  but also to induce general anesthesia. Recent in vitro studies suggest that <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid type A receptors  harboring a classical high-affinity benzodiazepine binding site  possess another &quot;nonclassical&quot; binding site for benzodiazepines. At present  it is unclear if  and to what extent  this novel nonclassical binding site is of relevance for the actions of benzodiazepines in the central nervous system.METHODS: Because neocortex is involved in mediating the sedative and hypnotic properties of general anesthetics  we quantified the actions of diazepam over a wide range of concentrations (from 10 nM up to 100 µM) in organotypic slice cultures using extracellular multiunit recordings of spontaneous action potential activity.RESULTS: Up to a concentration of 6.25 µM  diazepam reduced the activity of neocortical neurons  approaching a maximum of approximately 20%. This action was nullified by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. At concentrations &gt;12.5 µM  diazepam evoked a second concentration-dependent dampening of network activity. Unlike the low concentration effect  this high concentration component was resistant to flumazenil.CONCLUSIONS: Diazepam induced a biphasic attenuation of spontaneous action potential firing of neocortical neurons. Low to moderate concentrations caused a monotonic  mild depression that is mediated via the classical binding site as it is antagonized by flumazenil. However  the effects of diazepam observed at high concentrations were not affected by flumazenil. Hence  these findings support the concept of at least 2 different binding sites for benzodiazepines on <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. Furthermore  our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the classical high-affinity binding site mediates low-dose diazepam actions  such as amnesia  anxiolysis  and sedation  while a second  nonclassical and independent site contributes to the anesthetic effects of diazepam  such as hypnosis and immobility."
"287","20883706","11-Deoxycortisol impedes GABAergic neurotransmission and induces drug-resistant status epilepticus in mice.","Systemic injection of high doses of 11-deoxycortisol succinate had been reported to induce status epilepticus in rats and cats that was associated with paroxysmal epileptiform activity refractory to first generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Using patch clamp recordings we have investigated the mechanisms of 11-deoxycortisol-induced excitability and we have discovered that this molecule accelerates the decay time of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) mediated by GABA(A) receptors  both in neuronal cultures and in hippocampal slices. In addition  it reduces the amplitude and frequency of IPSCs. Thus  11-deoxycortisol action on GABAergic neurotransmission may be one of the underlying causes of convulsive seizures that had been observed in rats. In the present study  we have reproduced the ability of 11-deoxycortisol to induce convulsive seizures after intravenous infusion in mice. The threshold dose of 11-deoxycortisol necessary for seizure induction was also determined (0.95 mmol/kg). Furthermore  we have established that these seizures are completely refractory to several AEDs such as phenytoin (up to 100 mg/kg)  carbamazepine (up to 56 mg/kg)  and valproate (up to 300 mg/kg). Levetiracetam and diazepam afforded only limited protection at high doses  540 and 3-10 mg/kg  respectively. Interestingly  long-lasting seizures induced by 11-deoxycortisol in mice were not associated with typical neuropathological changes observed in other models of status epilepticus. We propose that 11-deoxycortisol-induced seizures may be an advantageous experimental model of drug-resistant epilepsy. Finally  better understanding of the pro-epileptic properties of 11-deoxycortisol is very important  because this endogenous steroid precursor may play a role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy.

Hyperthermia-induced seizure-susceptible (Hiss) rats are the novel rat model carrying a missense mutation (N1417H) of Scn1a  which is located in the third pore-forming region of the Na(v)1.1 channel. Here  we conducted behavioral and neurochemical studies to clarify the functional relevance of the Scn1a mutation in vivo and the mechanism underlying the vulnerability to hyperthermic seizures. Hiss rats showed markedly high susceptibility to hyperthermic seizures (mainly generalized clonic seizures) which were synchronously associated with paroxysmal epileptiform discharges. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain Fos expression revealed that hyperthermic seizures induced a widespread elevation of Fos-immunoreactivity in the cerebral cortices including the motor area  piriform  and insular cortex. In the subcortical regions  hyperthermic seizures enhanced Fos expression region--specifically in the limbic and paralimbic regions (e.g.  hippocampus  amygdala  and perirhinal-entorhinal cortex) without affecting other brain regions (e.g.  basal ganglia  diencephalon  and lower brainstem)  suggesting a primary involvement of limbic system in the induction of hyperthermic seizures. In addition  Hiss rats showed a significantly lower threshold than the control animals in inducing epileptiform discharges in response to local stimulation of the hippocampus (hippocampal afterdischarges). Furthermore  hyperthermic seizures in Hiss rats were significantly alleviated by the antiepileptic drugs  diazepam and sodium valproate  while phenytoin or ethosuximide were ineffective. The present findings support the notion that Hiss rats are useful as a novel rat model of febrile seizures and suggest that hyperexcitability of limbic neurons associated with Scn1a missense mutation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of febrile seizures."

For this purpose  we revised our humanized dynamic in vitro BBB model (DIV-BBBr) to incorporate modified hollow fibers that now feature transmural microholes (2 to 4<U+2009>µm Ø) allowing for the transendothelial trafficking of immune cells. As with the original model  this new DIV-BBBr reproduces most of the physiological characteristics of the BBB in vivo. Measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER)  sucrose permeability  and BBB integrity during reversible osmotic disruption with mannitol (1.6<U+2009>mol/L) showed that the microholes do not hamper the formation of a tight functional barrier. The in vivo rank permeability order of sucrose  phenytoin  and diazepam was successfully reproduced in vitro. Flow cessation followed by reperfusion (Fc/Rp) in the presence of circulating monocytes caused a biphasic BBB opening paralleled by a significant increase of proinflammatory cytokines and activated matrix metalloproteinases. We also observed abluminal extravasation of monocytes but only when the BBB was breached. In conclusion  the DIV-BBBr represents the most realistic in vitro system to study the immune cell trafficking across the BBB."

"293","20826313","Elevated BDNF after cocaine withdrawal facilitates LTP in medial prefrontal cortex by suppressing GABA inhibition.","Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to be involved in relapse after cocaine withdrawal  but the underlying cellular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here  we report that after terminating repeated cocaine exposure in rats  a gradual increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the mPFC facilitates activity-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses on layer V pyramidal neurons. This enhanced synaptic plasticity could be attributed to BDNF-induced suppression of GABAergic inhibition in the mPFC by reducing the surface expression of GABA(A) receptors. The BDNF effect was mediated by BDNF-TrkB-phosphatase 2A signaling pathway. Downregulating TrkB expression bilaterally in the mPFC reduced the locomotor hypersensitivity to cocaine 8 days after cocaine withdrawal. Thus  elevated BDNF expression after cocaine withdrawal sensitizes the excitatory synapses in the mPFC to undergo activity-induced persistent potentiation that may contribute to cue-induced drug craving and drug-seeking behavior."

The present study validates a rodent model of BI based on an ethologically relevant predator exposure paradigm. We show that individual differences in rat BI are stable and trait-like from adolescence into adulthood. Using in situ hybridization to quantify expression of the immediate early genes homer1a and fos as measures of neuronal activation  we show that individual differences in BI are correlated with the activation of various stress-responsive brain regions that include the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and CA3 region of the hippocampus. Further supporting the concept that threat-induced BI in rodents reflects levels of anxiety  we also show that BI is decreased by administration of the anxiolytic  diazepam. Finally  we developed criteria for identifying extreme BI animals that are stable in their expression of high levels of BI and also show that high BI (HBI) individuals exhibit maladaptive appetitive responses following stress exposure. These findings support the use of predator threat as a stimulus and HBI rats as a model to study mechanisms underlying extreme and stable BI in humans."

The present study was designed to explore the modulation of the effects of PHOS on convulsions by neurosteroids  progesterone (PROG)  and 4'-chlorodiazepam (4'-CD)  in both acute and chronic seizure models. In acute study  seizures were induced by either pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injection or maximal electroshock seizures  while in the chronic study  kindling was induced by injecting PTZ (30 mg/kg  s.c.) on alternate days three times in a week. Oxidative stress was assessed in the brain by measuring the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA)  acetylcholinesterase (AChE)  and non-protein thiol (NP-SH). PROG and 4'-CD were able to modulate the PHOS-induced convulsions in acute PTZ convulsions as well as in chronic kindling model. However  they failed to reverse the derangements in oxidative stress parameters of MDA and NP-SH produced by PHOS in kindled animals. PROG significantly increased the AChE activity in untreated rats  while PROG and 4'-CD reversed the AChE activity inhibition induced by PHOS. The study indicates a possible anticonvulsive mechanism of neurosteroids  since both PROG and 4'-CD reversed PHOS-induced inhibition of AChE activity. The neurosteroids seem to play a protective role in PHOS-induced convulsions besides their antioxidant property."

The ethyl acetate soluble fraction of Morus alba (EASF) 25  50  100 mg/kg and diazepam (1 mg/kg) per day was administered 60 min prior to the stress procedure. The behavioral and biochemical parameters such as open field  cognitive dysfunction; leucocytes count; blood glucose and corticosteroid levels were determined. On day 10  the rats were sacrificed and biochemical assessment of superoxide dismutase (SOD)  lipid peroxidation (LPO)  catalase (CAT)  and glutathione reductase (GSH) in whole rat brain were performed.RESULTS: Chronic restraint stress produced cognitive dysfunction  altered behavioral parameters  increased leucocytes count  SOD  LPO  glucose and corticosterone levels  with concomitant decrease in CAT and GSH activities. Gastric ulceration  adrenal gland and spleen weights were also used as the stress indices. All these RS induced perturbations were attenuated by EASF of Morus alba.DISCUSSION: The results of the study suggest that in addition to its classically established pharmacological activities  the plant also has immense potential as an anti-stress agent of great therapeutic relevance.CONCLUSION: This study indicates the beneficial role of Morus alba for the treatment of oxidative stress-induced disorders."

Moreover  glycine and glycine modulators have beneficial effects in patients with schizophrenia  particularly when added on to existing therapy. As glycine is an obligatory co-agonist at the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor  blockade of glycine uptake at the glycine transporter type-1 (GlyT1) can enhance low glutamatergic tone. L-687 414 is an antagonist at the glycine modulatory site of the NMDA complex and  behaviorally  increases locomotion. A series of GlyT1 inhibitors along with other psychoactive compounds were examined for their ability to enhance or inhibit the action of L-687 414. GlyT1 inhibitors and the other compounds were examined initially for effects on [(3)H]-glycine uptake in CHO cells expressing hGlyT1b cDNA and for their ability to displace the NMDA-glycine site ligand [(3)H]-L-689 560 from isolated rat forebrain membrane preparations. The in vivo activity of these compounds was determined in mice by measuring their ability to prevent L-687 414-induced hyperlocomotion. GlyT1 inhibitors blocked [(3)H]-glycine uptake in cells expressing the human transporter; other compounds had little or no activity. None of the compounds had affinity for the glycine site of the NMDA receptor complex. Hyperlocomotion induced by L-687 414 was dose-dependently reduced by GlyT1 inhibitors and antipsychotic drugs but not by morphine  fluoxetine or a moderate dose of diazepam. Therefore  this behavioral approach can reliably detect GlyT1 inhibitors which  in turn  may have some activity in common with drugs having antipsychotic effects."

Neurosteroid withdrawal occurs during menstruation and is associated with a marked increase in expression of GABA-A receptor a4-subunit  a key subunit linked to enhanced neuronal excitability  seizure susceptibility and benzodiazepine resistance. However  the molecular mechanisms underlying the upregulation of a4-subunit expression remain unclear. Here we utilized the progesterone receptor (PR) knockout mouse to investigate molecular pathways of PR and the transcription factor early growth response factor-3 (Egr3) in regulation of the GABA-A receptor a4-subunit expression in the hippocampus in a mouse neurosteroid withdrawal paradigm. Neurosteroid withdrawal induced a threefold increase in a4-subunit expression in wild-type mice  but this upregulation was unchanged in PR knockout mice. The expression of Egr3  which controls a4-subunit transcription  was increased significantly following neurosteroid withdrawal in wild-type and PR knockout mice. Neurosteroid withdrawal-induced a4-subunit upregulation was completely suppressed by antisense Egr3 inhibition. In the hippocampus kindling model of epilepsy  there was heightened seizure activity  significant reduction in the antiseizure sensitivity of diazepam (a benzodiazepine insensitive at a4ß<U+03B3>-receptors) and conferral of increased seizure protection of flumazenil (a low-affinity agonist at a4ß<U+03B3>-receptors) in neurosteroid-withdrawn wild-type and PR knockout mice. These observations are consistent with enhanced a4-containing receptor abundance in vivo. Neurosteroid withdrawal-induced seizure exacerbation  diazepam insensitivity  and flumazenil efficacy in the kindling model were reversed by inhibition of Egr3. These results indicate that neurosteroid withdrawal-induced upregulation of GABA-A receptor a4-subunit expression is mediated by the Egr3 via a PR-independent signaling pathway. These findings help advance our understanding of the molecular basis of catamenial epilepsy  a neuroendocrine condition that occurs around the perimenstrual period and is characterized by neurosteroid withdrawal-linked seizure exacerbations in women with epilepsy."

The effect on anxiety was assessed by employing elevated plus maze  open field test  light/dark test and social interaction test. Only the higher dose (20mg/kg  i.p.) of curcumin produced significant antianxiety-like effect in stressed mice. Pre-treatment with aminoguanidine (50mg/kg; i.p.)  an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor significantly enhanced the anxiolytic-like effect of curcumin in stressed mice as compared to curcumin and aminoguanidine per se in stressed mice. Pretreatment with 7-nitroindazole (20mg/kg)  a neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor did not significantly affect the antianxiety-like response of curcumin in stressed mice as compared to curcumin per se. Restraint stress significantly increased plasma nitrite levels in mice. Curcumin (20mg/kg  i.p.) and aminoguanidine significantly decreased plasma nitrite levels in stressed mice. The combination of aminoguanidine and curcumin significantly decreased the plasma nitrite levels as compared to curcumin and aminoguanidine per se in stressed mice. Curcumin and aminoguanidine did not produce any significant change in brain GABA contents of the animals. Diazepam (2mg/kg) produced significant anxiolytic-like effect only in unstressed mice  but could not exert significant anxiolysis in stressed mice. However  diazepam significantly increased GABA contents in both unstressed and stressed mice as compared to respective control groups. These findings suggest the possible involvement of only inducible NOS and not neuronal NOS in antianxiety-like effect of curcumin."

D(3)(-/-) mice treated with diazepam (0.1 or 0.5mg/kg) exhibited a better behavioral response in the EPM than their wild type (WT). Furthermore  in D(3)(-/-) mice  but not in WT  1mg/kg diazepam induced anxiolytic effects at all testing times. The contribution of DRsD3 in the anxiolytic effects of diazepam was confirmed by similar results obtained in EPM by using the selective DRD3 antagonist U99194A (10mg/kg) in combination with diazepam  in WT animals. D(3)(-/-) mice treated with diazepam (all doses)  also showed a decrease in grooming behavior. However  the [(3)H]flunitrazepam autoradiographic analysis revealed no significant changes in D(3)(-/-) mice compared to WT  suggesting that if <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid receptor GABA(A) changes are involved  they do not occur at the level of binding to benzodiazepine site. These data suggest that D(3)(-/-) mice exhibit low baseline anxiety levels and provide the evidence that the DRD3 is involved in the modulation of benzodiazepine anxiolytic effects."
"301","20614851","Benzodiazepine receptor agonists cause drug-specific and state-specific alterations in EEG power and acetylcholine release in rat pontine reticular formation.","STUDY OBJECTIVES: Benzodiazepine (BDZ) and non-benzodiazepine (NBDZ) hypnotics enhance GABAergic transmission and are widely used for the treatment of insomnia. In the pontine reticular formation (PRF)  GABA inhibits rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and acetylcholine (ACh) release. No previous studies have characterized the effects of BDZ and NBDZ hypnotics on ACh release in the PRF. This study tested 2 hypotheses: (1) that microdialysis delivery of zolpidem  eszopiclone  and diazepam to rat PRF alters ACh release in PRF and electroencephalographic (EEG) delta power and (2) that intravenous (i.v.) administration of eszopiclone to non-anesthetized rat alters ACh release in the PRF  sleep  and EEG delta power.DESIGN: A within- and between-groups experimental design.SETTING: University of Michigan.PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Adult male Crl:CD*(SD) (Sprague-Dawley) rats (n = 57).INTERVENTIONS: In vivo microdialysis of the PRF in rats anesthetized with isoflurane was used to derive the concentration-response effects of zolpidem  eszopiclone  and diazepam on ACh release. Chronically instrumented rats were used to quantify the effects of eszopiclone (3 mg/kg  i.v.) on ACh release in the PRF  sleep-wake states  and cortical EEG power.MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: ACh release was significantly increased by microdialysis delivery to the PRF of zolpidem and eszopiclone but not diazepam. EEG delta power was increased by zolpidem and diazepam but not by eszopiclone administered to the PRF. Eszopiclone (i.v.) decreased ACh release in the PRF of both anesthetized and non-anesthetized rats. Eszopiclone (i.v.) prevented REM sleep and increased EEG delta power.CONCLUSION: The concentration-response data provide the first functional evidence that multiple GABA(A) receptor subtypes are present in rat PRF. Intravenously administered eszopiclone prevented REM sleep  decreased ACh release in the PRF  and increased EEG delta power. The effects of eszopiclone are consistent with evidence that ACh release in the PRF is lower during NREM sleep than during REM sleep  and with data showing that cholinergic stimulation of the PRF activates the cortical EEG."

These areas were selected because of their important participation in the regulation of anxiety and defensive responses.METHODS: The anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam was evaluated with the rat burying behaviour test. The pain-induced functional impairment in the rat (PIFIR) model was used to study the effects of diazepam on nociception. Nociception was induced by intra-articular injection of 15% uric acid into the knee joint of the right hind limb.RESULTS: Sole exposure to the burying behaviour test produced a slight non-significant hyperalgesic effect. Diazepam injection (2.0 microg/0.4 microl) into the ABLA or dPAG produced a reduction in cumulative burying behaviour--an anxiolytic-like effect--together with an increase in burying behaviour latency. Such reduced experimental anxiety was paralleled by an antinociceptive response (i.e.  increased use of the uric-acid-injected limb). Reduced experimental anxiety was correlated with antinociception after diazepam infusion into both brain structures.CONCLUSIONS: Diazepam-reduced experimental anxiety was paralleled by antinociceptive effects."

Blood samples were taken after ultrasound application for corticosterone analysis. Ultrasound-induced c-Fos expression was measured in different periaqueductal gray (PAG) and amygdala subregions after treatment with diazepam or Ro 64-6198.RESULTS: Ultrasound application increased heart rate and body temperature  but did not alter plasma corticosterone levels. Ultrasound application increased c-Fos expression in the dorsal and dorsolateral PAG (dPAG  dlPAG) and amygdaloid subregions. Diazepam  but not Ro 64-6198  reduced c-Fos expression in the dPAG/dlPAG  while Ro 64-6198  but not diazepam  reduced c-Fos expression in the central amygdala.CONCLUSIONS: Similar to human panic attacks  ultrasound application to LH rats activated the autonomic  but not the neuroendocrine  stress system. Also  like in humans  the current data confirm and extend that the dPAG/dlPAG plays a key role in ultrasound-induced escape behavior. These observations suggest that ultrasound-induced escape behaviors in LH rats have face and construct validity for panic disorders."
"306","20505082","Amygdala-specific reduction of alpha1-GABAA receptors disrupts the anticonvulsant, locomotor, and sedative, but not anxiolytic, effects of benzodiazepines in mice.","The heterogeneity and distribution of GABA(A) receptor subunits mediates differential roles in behavior. It is thought that particular behavioral responses to benzodiazepine (BZ) ligands might be associated with an action at a regionally defined receptor subtype. However  the role of specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes in particular brain regions is less clear. Such detailed knowledge of regional alpha1-GABA(A) receptor function will advance our understanding of the neural circuitry underlying the role of GABA(A) receptors and the effects of GABA(A)-modulating drugs on behavior. By combining inducible  site-specific alpha1 subunit deletion  using a lentivirus expressing Cre-recombinase in mice with the alpha1 subunit gene flanked by loxP sites  we examine baseline and pharmacological effects of deletion of amygdala alpha1-GABA(A) receptors. We find that amygdala-specific reduction of alpha1 receptor subunits does not affect mRNA or protein levels of amygdala alpha2 or alpha3 subunit receptors. Nor does this inducible reduction affect baseline locomotion or measures of anxiety. However  we also find that this inducible  site-specific deletion does disrupt the normal sedative-locomotor inhibition as well as the anticonvulsive effects  of two distinct BZ-site ligands  diazepam and zolpidem  which is relatively alpha1-subunit selective. These data  using inducible  region and subunit-specific deletion  combined with pharmacogenetic approaches  demonstrate that amygdala expression of the alpha1-GABA(A) receptor subunit is required for normal BZ effects on sedation  locomotion  and seizure inhibition  but not for anxiolysis."
"307","20498005","Development of a prolonged calcium plateau in hippocampal neurons in rats surviving status epilepticus induced by the organophosphate diisopropylfluorophosphate.","Organophosphate (OP) compounds are among the most lethal chemical weapons ever developed and are irreversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase. Exposure to majority of OP produces status epilepticus (SE) and severe cholinergic symptoms that if left untreated are fatal. Survivors of OP intoxication often suffer from irreversible brain damage and chronic neurological disorders. Although pilocarpine has been used to model SE following OP exposure  there is a need to establish a SE model that uses an OP compound in order to realistically mimic both acute and long-term effects of nerve agent intoxication. Here we describe the development of a rat model of OP-induced SE using diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). The mortality  behavioral manifestations  and electroencephalogram (EEG) profile for DFP-induced SE (4 mg/kg  sc) were identical to those reported for nerve agents. However  significantly higher survival rates were achieved with an improved dose regimen of DFP and treatment with pralidoxime chloride (25 mg/kg  im)  atropine (2 mg/kg  ip)  and diazepam (5 mg/kg  ip) making this model ideal to study chronic effects of OP exposure. Further  DFP treatment produced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated significant elevation in hippocampal neuronal [Ca(2+)](i) that lasted for weeks after the initial SE. These results provided direct evidence that DFP-induced SE altered Ca(2+) dynamics that could underlie some of the long-term plasticity changes associated with OP toxicity. This model is ideally suited to test effective countermeasures for OP exposure and study molecular mechanisms underlying neurological disorders following OP intoxication."

The effects of TBI on the essential functions of inhibitory GABA-A receptors  however  are poorly understood.METHODS: We used Western blot procedures to test whether in vivo TBI in rat altered the protein expression of hippocampal GABA-A receptor subunits alpha1  alpha2  alpha3  alpha5  beta3  and gamma2 at 3 h  6 h  24 h  and 7 days post-injury. We then used pre-injury injections of MK-801 to block calcium influx through the NMDA receptor  diltiazem to block L-type voltage-gated calcium influx  or diazepam to enhance chloride conductance  and re-examined the protein expressions of alpha1  alpha2  alpha3  and gamma2  all of which were altered by TBI in the first study and all of which are important constituents in benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA-A receptors.RESULTS: Western blot analysis revealed no injury-induced alterations in protein expression for GABA-A receptor alpha2 or alpha5 subunits at any time point post-injury. Significant time-dependent changes in alpha1  alpha3  beta3  and gamma2 protein expression. The pattern of alterations to GABA-A subunits was nearly identical after diltiazem and diazepam treatment  and MK-801 normalized expression of all subunits 24 hours post-TBI.CONCLUSIONS: These studies are the first to demonstrate that GABA-A receptor subunit expression is altered by TBI in vivo  and these alterations may be driven by calcium-mediated cascades in hippocampal neurons. Changes in GABA-A receptors in the hippocampus after TBI may have far-reaching consequences considering their essential importance in maintaining inhibitory balance and their extensive impact on neuronal function."

Two of these peptides  ODN and TTN  bind to the GABA(A) receptor and modulate its sensitivity to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). We have found that depolarization of mouse primary astrocytes induces the rapid release and processing of ACBP to the active peptides. We previously showed that ODN can trigger the rapid sporulation of the social amoeba Dictyostelium. Using this bioassay  we now show that astrocytes release the endozepine peptides within 10 min of exposure to the steroids cortisol  pregnenolone  pregnenolone sulfate  or progesterone. ACBP lacks a signal sequence for secretion through the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi pathway and its secretion is not affected by addition of brefeldin A  a well known inhibitor of the classical secretion pathway  suggesting that it follows an unconventional pathway for secretion. Moreover  induction of autophagy by addition of rapamycin also resulted in rapid release of ACBP indicating that this protein uses components of the autophagy pathway for secretion. Following secretion  ACBP is proteolytically cleaved to the active neuropeptides by protease activity on the surface of astrocytes. Neurosteroids  such as pregnenolone sulfate  were previously shown to modulate the excitatory/inhibitory balance in brain through increased release of glutamate and decreased release of GABA. These effects of steroids in neurons will be reinforced by the release of endozepines from astrocytes shown here  and suggest an orchestrated astrocyte-neuron cross-talk that can affect a broad spectrum of behavioral functions."

Three second-generation AEDs (gabapentin  topiramate  and lamotrigine) were recently approved in Japan. Levetiracetam is currently under review for approval by the Japanese regulatory agency. An ideal AED would have a broad-spectrum activity to control multiple types of seizures  favorable safety profile  limited potential for drug-drug interaction  many bioequivalent formulations  long half life to allow infrequent administration  and antiepileptogenic effects that may provide a fundamental cure of epileptic patients by suppressing the development of epileptogenic network and neutralizing previously established epileptogenic foci in the brain. The second-generation AEDs have been developed to possess some of these ideal properties. All the second-generation AEDs are efficacious for the treatment of patients with partial seizures. In addition  levetiracetam  topiramate  lamotrigine  and zonisamide are effective for the treatment of patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures  absences  myoclonic seizures  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome  and West syndrome; however  lamotrigine is not effective for the treatment of patients with myoclonic seizures. Rufinamide and felbamate are useful for the treatment of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; however owing to its serious adverse effects  including aplastic anemia and hepatic failure  felbamate is used as the last resort for the treatment of patients with intractable seizures. Vigabatrin is particularly effective for the treatment of patients with West syndrome; however  the patients need to be regularly monitored for the development of peripheral visual field defect. Gabapentin  oxcarbazepine  vigabatrin  and tiagabine are ineffective for the treatment of patients with absences and/or myoclonic seizures and may aggravate these conditions. Treatment with levetiracetam or topiramate (off-label use) is the new option for patients with refractory status epilepticus  which is characterized by downregulation of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid system  because these drugs act via different mechanisms and are rapidly titratable  especially intravenous levetiracetam. The pharmacokinetic profiles of levetiracetam  gabapentin  and pregabalin are favorable: these drugs exhibit minimal protein binding  do not undergo hepatic metabolism  are not involved in any clinically relevant drug interactions  and rarely lead to the development of serious adverse effects. In general  levetiracetam is probably the closest to being the ideal AED because of its broad-spectrum favorable pharmacokinetic profile and safety profile as well as because of the availability of its parenteral formulation. Among the injectable AEDs  fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug and is used to treat patients with status epilepticus. Systemic and local side effects of this drug are fewer than those of phenytoin. Lorazepam  a benzodiazepine is used as the first-line AED for the treatment of patients with status epilepticus. The effects of this drug are more prolonged than those of diazepam. Intravenous administration of valproic acid is regarded as a new treatment option for patients with status epilepticus  because sedative and negative effects on the cardiorespiratory system of this drug are lesser than those of the traditional injectable AEDs. These novel medications will aid the improvement of the quality of life of epileptic patients through improved seizure control and reduced adverse effects."

A large number of peptides have been detected in mouse brain extracts using mass spectrometry-based peptidomics studies  and 850 peptides have been identified. Half of these peptides are derived from secretory pathway proteins and many are known bioactive neuropeptides which activate G protein-coupled receptors; these are termed &quot;classical neuropeptides&quot;. In addition  427 peptides were identified that are derived from non-secretory pathway proteins; the majority are cystosolic  and the remainder are mitochondrial  nuclear  lysosomal  or membrane proteins. Many of these peptides represent the N- or C-terminus of the protein  rather than internal fragments  raising the possibility that they are formed by selective processing rather than protein degradation. In addition to consideration of the cleavage site required to generate the intracellular peptides  their potential functions are discussed. Several of the cytosolic peptides were previously found to interact with receptors and/or otherwise influence cellular activity; examples include hemorphins  hemopressins  diazepam binding inhibitor  and hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide. The possibility that these peptides are secreted from cells and function in cell-cell signaling is discussed. If these intracellular peptides can be shown to be secreted in levels sufficient to produce a biological effect  they would appropriately be called &quot;non-classical neuropeptides&quot; by analogy with non-classical neurotransmitters such as nitric oxide and anandamide. It is also possible that intracellular peptides function as &quot;microproteins&quot; and modulate protein-protein interactions; evidence for this function is discussed  along with future directions that are needed to establish this and other possible functions for peptides."

We have previously reported that phospholipase C-related inactive protein (PRIP) is a modulator of GABA(A) receptor trafficking and that knockout (KO) mice exhibit a diazepam-insensitive phenotype in the hippocampus. The alpha subunit affects diazepam sensitivity; alpha1  2  3  and 5 subunits assemble with any form of beta and the gamma2 subunits to produce diazepam-sensitive receptors  whereas alpha4 or alpha6/beta/gamma2 receptors are diazepam-insensitive. Here  we investigated how PRIP is implicated in the diazepam-insensitive phenotype using cerebellar granule cells in animals expressing predominantly the alpha6 subunit. The expression of alpha1/beta/gamma2 diazepam-sensitive receptors was decreased in the PRIP-1 and 2 double KO cerebellum without any change in the total number of benzodiazepine-binding sites as assessed by radioligand-binding assay. Since levels of the alpha6 subunit were increased  the alpha1/beta/gamma2 receptors might be replaced with alpha6 subunit-containing receptors. Then  we further performed autoradiographic and electrophysiologic analyses. These results suggest that the expression of alpha6/delta receptors was decreased in cerebellar granule neurons  while that of alpha6/gamma2 receptors was increased. PRIP-1 and 2 double KO mice exhibit a diazepam-insensitive phenotype because of a decrease in diazepam-sensitive (alpha1/gamma2) and increase in diazepam-insensitive (alpha6/gamma2) GABA(A) receptors in the cerebellar granule cells."

In order to induce kindling  pentetrazol at a dose of 40 mg/kg was injected intraperitoneally once every 48 h. Behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) seizures were observed for 20 min following pentetrazol administration. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of AIDA (1000 nmol/site) resulted in a significant inhibitory effect on pentetrazol-induced kindled seizures  and this effect was antagonized by a group I mGluR agonist  (RS)-3 5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ((RS)-3 5-DHPG). The effect of AIDA (200 nmol/site) on pentetrazol-induced kindled seizures was augmented by the simultaneous use of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mimetic drugs  such as NNC-711 and diazepam. Moreover  the effect of AIDA (1000 nmol/site) on pentetrazol-induced kindled seizures was antagonized by a GABA(A) receptor antagonist  bicuculline and a GABA(C) receptor antagonist  (1 2 5 6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl) methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA). It can be concluded that AIDA had an anticonvulsant effect on pentetrazol-induced kindled seizures  which was partially mediated by the GABAergic mechanism through GABA(A) and GABA(C) receptors."
"314","20371268","Vasopressinergic network abnormalities potentiate conditioned anxious state of rats subjected to maternal hyperthyroidism.","We have previously reported that a mild maternal hyperthyroidism in rats impairs stress coping of adult offspring. To assess anxiogenesis in this rat model of stress over-reactivity  we used two behavioural tests for unconditional and conditional anxious states: elevated plus maze test (EPM) and Vogel conflict test (VCT). In the latter one  arginine vasopressin (AVP) release was enhanced due to osmotic stress. With the EPM test no differences were observed between maternal hyperthyroid rats (MH) and controls. However  with the VCT  the MH showed increased anxiety-like behaviour. This behavioural difference was abolished by diazepam. Plasma AVP concentration curve as a function of water deprivation (WD) time showed a marked increase  reaching its maximal levels within half the time of controls and another significant difference after VCT. A general increase in Fos expression in hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) was observed during WD and after VCT. There was also a significant increase of AVP immunoreactivity in anterior hypothalamic area. A large number of Herring bodies were observed in the AVP containing fibres of MH hypothalamic-neurohypophysial system. Numerous reciprocal synaptic connections between AVP and corticotropin releasing factor containing neurons in MH ventromedial PVN were observed by electron microscopy. These results suggest that a mild maternal hyperthyroidism could induce an aberrant organization in offspring's hypothalamic stress related regions which could mediate the enhanced anxiety seen in this animal model."

Under-threshold hypnotic dosage of diazepam and the hypnotic dosage of pentobarbital sodium can block the sophoridine kinded seizure in mice  but the phenytoin sodium can not block the seizure  also the dosage of it can block the maximal electroconvulsive shock (MES) seizure.CONCLUSION: Sophoridine-induced synchronous oscillations in the hippocampus could elicit the generation and development of seizure. And the hippocampus might play the crucial role and be the original part of the seizure. Sophoridine kinded seizure might belong to clonic seizures  and the diazepam is the ideal agent for the treatment."

We have now examined the effects of neonatal estradiol administration in female rats on brain concentrations of the neuroactive steroids allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone  expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits  and behavioral sensitivity to benzodiazepines and allopregnanolone. Administration of beta-estradiol 3-benzoate on the day of birth resulted in marked decreases in the concentrations of progesterone and allopregnanolone in the cerebral cortex at 21  60  and 180 days after birth. The concentrations of tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone  17beta-estradiol  and dehydroepiandrosterone in the brain at 60 days were not affected by such treatment. Neonatal administration of beta-estradiol 3-benzoate also increased the cerebrocortical abundance of alpha(1)  alpha(2)  and gamma(2) subunits of the GABA(A) receptor without affecting that of alpha(3)  alpha(4)  alpha(5)  or delta subunits. Diazepam induced a greater reduction in locomotor activity as well as a more pronounced anxiolytic-like effect in the elevated plus-maze test in rats subjected to neonatal treatment with beta-estradiol 3-benzoate than in vehicle-treated controls  while allopregnanolone induced a similar effect in both groups. These effects of estradiol suggest that it plays a major role in regulation both of GABAergic transmission and of the abundance of endogenous modulators of such transmission during development of the central nervous system."

GABAergic spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and mIPSCs) and tonic (extrasynaptic) whole cell currents were recorded in control rat hippocampal dentate granule cells (DGCs) and at 90days after controlled cortical impact (CCI). At 34 degrees C  in CCI DGCs  sIPSC frequency and amplitude were unchanged  whereas mIPSC frequency was decreased (3.10+/-0.84Hz  n=16  and 2.44+/-0.67Hz  n=7  p&lt;0.05). At 23 degrees C  300nM diazepam increased peak amplitude of mIPSCs in control and CCI DGCs  but the increase was 20% higher in control (26.81+/-2.2pA and 42.60+/-1.22pA  n=9  p=0.031) compared to CCI DGCs (33.46+/-2.98pA and 46.13+/-1.09pA  n=10  p=0.047). At 34 degrees C  diazepam did not prolong decay time constants (6.59+/-0.12ms and 6.62+/-0.98ms  n=9  p=0.12)  the latter suggesting that CCI resulted in benzodiazepine-insensitive pharmacology in synaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). In CCI DGCs  peak amplitude of mIPSCs was inhibited by 100microM furosemide (51.30+/-0.80pA at baseline and 43.50+/-5.30pA after furosemide  n=5  p&lt;0.001)  a noncompetitive antagonist of GABA(A)Rs with an enhanced affinity to alpha4 subunit-containing receptors. Potentiation of tonic current by the GABA(A)R delta subunit-preferring competitive agonist THIP (1 and 3microM) was increased in CCI DGCs (47% and 198%) compared to control DGCs (13% and 162%)  suggesting the presence of larger tonic current in CCI DGCs; THIP (1microM) had no effect on mIPSCs. Taken together  these results demonstrate alterations in synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs in DGCs following CCI."

Recently  it was demonstrated that the point mutation gamma 2F77I causes a drastic change in the affinity of a variety of benzodiazepine agonists or inverse agonists in receptor binding studies. Here we investigated the potency and efficacy of 10 benzodiazepine site ligands from 6 structural classes in wild-type and gamma 2F77I point mutated recombinant GABA(A) receptors composed of alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2  alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2  alpha 3 beta 3 gamma 2  alpha 4 beta 3 gamma 2  alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2  and alpha 6 beta 3 gamma 2 subunits. Results indicate that the effects of the benzodiazepine site ligands zolpidem  zopiclone  Cl218872  L-655 708 and DMCM were nearly completely eliminated in all mutated receptors up to a 1 microM concentration. The effects of bretazenil  Ro15-1788 or abecarnil were eliminated in some  but not all mutated receptors  suggesting that the gamma 2F77I mutation differentially influences the actions of these ligands in different receptor subtypes. In addition  this point mutation also influences the efficacy of diazepam for enhancing GABA-induced chloride flux  suggesting that the amino acid residue gamma 2F77 might also be involved in the transduction of the effect of benzodiazepines from binding to gating. The application of these drugs in a novel mouse model is discussed."

Previous studies have shown that central administration of a DBI processing product  the octadecaneuropeptide ODN  causes a marked inhibition of food consumption in rodents. Paradoxically  however  the effect of food restriction on DBI gene expression has never been investigated. Here  we show that in mice  acute fasting dramatically reduces DBI mRNA levels in the hypothalamus and the ependyma bordering the third and lateral ventricles. I.p. injection of insulin  but not of leptin  selectively stimulated DBI expression in the lateral ventricle area. These data support the notion that glial cells  through the production of endozepines  may relay peripheral signals to neurons involved in the central regulation of energy homeostasis."

Biophysical studies have shown that smaller sized inhaled anesthetics promote oligomerization by inducing perturbation of three critical amino acid residues (G29  A30  and I31) located in the helix-loop-helix domain of Abeta. In this present experimental study  using state-of-the-art nuclear magnetic resonance  we have monitored the influence of a larger sized intravenous anesthetic  diazepam  as well as diazepam co-administered with halothane  on Abeta. It was concluded that diazepam (in isolation) does not interact with the G29  A30  and I31 residues  and no Abeta oligomerization occurs in the presence of 0.101 mM diazepam  even after 63 days. However  when diazepam was co-administered with halothane  profound Abeta oligomerization is observed. These results strengthen the hypothesis that the presence of smaller molecular sized anesthetic is instrumental in promoting Abeta oligomerization even when co-administered with a larger sized anesthetic  namely diazepam."

These agents are routinely used in the symptomatic treatment of neurodegenerative disease. Each agent is reviewed in terms of its effects on pathogenic proteins  proteasomal function  mitochondrial viability  mitochondrial function and metabolism  mitochondrial permeability transition pore development  cellular viability  and apoptosis. Effects on the metabolism of the neurodegenerative disease pathogenic proteins alpha-synuclein  beta-amyloid  and tau  including tau phosphorylation  are particularly addressed  with application to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Limitations of the current data are detailed and predictive criteria for translational clinical neuroprotection are proposed and discussed.

Those with multiple neuroprotective mechanisms include pramipexole  thioridazine  olanzapine  quetiapine  lithium  valproate  desipramine  maprotiline  clonazepam  and melatonin. Those best viewed circumspectly in neurodegenerative disease until clinical disease course outcomes data become available  include several antipsychotics  lithium  oxcarbazepine  valproate  several tricyclic antidepressants  certain SSRIs  diazepam  and possibly diphenhydramine.

FSL rats showed an increased behavioral response to low doses of diazepam  as compared to either Sprague Dawley (SD) or Flinder Resistant Line (FRL) rats used as controls. Diazepam at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg  i.p.  induced a robust impairment of motor coordination in FSL rats  but was virtually inactive in SD or FRL rats. The increased responsiveness of FSL rats was not due to changes in the brain levels of diazepam or its active metabolites  or to increases in the number or affinity of benzodiazepine recognition sites  as shown by the analysis of [(3)H]-flunitrazepam binding in the hippocampus  cerebral cortex or cerebellum. We therefore examined whether FSL rats differed from control rats for the expression levels of the K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter  KCC2  which transports Cl(-) ions out of neurons  thus creating the concentration gradient that allows Cl(-) influx through the anion channel associated with GABA(A) receptors. Combined immunoblot and immunohistochemical data showed a widespread increase in KCC2 expression in FSL rats  as compared with control rats. The increase was more prominent in the cerebellum  where KCC2 was largely expressed in the granular layer. These data raise the interesting possibility that a spontaneous depressive state in animals is associated with an amplified GABAergic transmission in the CNS resulting from an enhanced expression of KCC2."

Rats were randomly divided into eight groups of six rats each: nonepileptic rats treated with saline; PTZ (60 mg/kg  IP)-induced seizure rats treated with saline; PTZ-induced seizure rats pretreated with n-hexane  chloroform  ethyl acetate  n-butanol  and water extracts of C. asiatica; and PTZ-induced seizure rats pretreated with diazepam (2mg/kg body wt). The seized rats pretreated with different extracts were administered a dose of 200mg/kg body wt orally for 1 week before induction of epilepsy. Increased acetylcholine content and decreased acetylcholinesterase activity were recorded in different brain regions during PTZ-induced seizures. Pretreatment with C. asiatica extracts caused recovery of the levels of acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase. These findings suggest that C. asiatica causes perceptible changes in the cholinergic system as one of the facets of its anticonvulsant activity."

Neither midazolam nor diazepam affected typical periodic slow-wave complexes. However  in the patients with atypical EEG abnormalities  midazolam  like diazepam  attenuated sharp or sharp-and-slow waves  and therefore made the identification of periodic slow-wave paroxysms easier. In the patients with normal EEGs  both midazolam and diazepam revealed typical periodic complexes on EEG recording in the same 3 patients.

The findings suggest that midazolam or diazepam administration increases the contribution of EEG recording in atypical cases with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis."
"325","20099997","Severe lactic acidosis after an iatrogenic propylene glycol overdose.","Propylene glycol is a diluent found in many intravenous and oral drugs  including phenytoin  diazepam  and lorazepam. Propylene glycol is eliminated from the body by oxidation through alcohol dehydrogenase to form lactic acid. Under normal conditions  the body converts lactate to pyruvate and metabolizes pyruvate through the Krebs cycle. Lactic acidosis has occurred in patients  often those with renal dysfunction  who were receiving prolonged infusions of drugs that contain propylene glycol as a diluent. We describe a 50-year-old man who experienced severe lactic acidosis after receiving an accidental overdose of lorazepam  which contains propylene glycol. The patient was acutely intoxicated  with a serum ethanol concentration of 406 mg/dl. He had choked on a large piece of meat and subsequently experienced pulseless electrical activity with ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. He was brought to the emergency department; within 2 hours  he was admitted to the intensive care unit for initiation of the hypothermia protocol. The patient began to experience generalized tonic-clonic seizures 12 hours later  which resolved after several boluses of lorazepam. A lorazepam infusion was started; however  it was inadvertently administered at a rate of 2 mg/minute instead of the standard rate of 2 mg/hour. Ten hours later  the administration error was recognized and the infusion stopped. The patient's peak propylene glycol level was 659 mg/dl  pH 6.9  serum bicarbonate level 5 mEq/L  and lactate level 18.6 mmol/L. Fomepizole was started the next day and was continued until hospital day 3. Continuous renal replacement therapy was started and then replaced with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for the remainder of the hospital stay. The patient's acidosis resolved by day 3  when his propylene glycol level had decreased to 45 mg/dl. Fomepizole was discontinued  but the patient's prognosis was poor (anoxic brain injury); thus care was withdrawn and the patient died. Although the patient's outcome was death  his lactic acidosis was treated successfully with fomepizole and CVVH. Clinicians should be aware that an iatrogenic overdose of lorazepam may result in severe propylene glycol toxicity  which may be treated with fomepizole and CVVH."

Then GABA(A) receptor mRNAs were evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.RESULTS: JuA at the low dose of 41 microM (about 0.05 g/l) induced significant increase of GABA(A) receptor alpha1  alpha5  beta2 subunit mRNAs in both 24 and 72h treatments. JuA at the high dose of 82 microM (about 0.1g/l) significantly increased GABA(A) receptor alpha1  alpha5 subunit mRNA levels and decreased beta2 subunit mRNA level at 24h treatment  and decreased GABA(A) receptor subunit alpha1  beta2 mRNAs expression at 72h treatment. DZP of 10 microM significantly increased expression of GABA(A) receptor subunit alpha1  alpha5 and decreased expression of beta2 at 24h treatment  and decreased alpha1  alpha5  beta2 subunits gene expression at 72h treatment.CONCLUSION: Differences in alterations in GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNAs expression following JuA and DZP treatments could help to explain the differences in the pharmacological action of the two drugs."

Although many studies have assessed changes to brain uptake of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in chemically and electrically induced seizure models  there are limited data available on changes to brain uptake of AEDs in spontaneous seizure animal models  such as genetic absence epilepsy. 2. In the present study  the brain uptake of diazepam and phenytoin was assessed in a genetic mouse model of absence seizures harbouring a human GABA(A) receptor gamma2-subunit gene GABRG2 mutation (R43Q) and results were compared with those obtained during acute seizures induced by subcutaneous administration of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ; 90 mg/kg). Diazepam and phenytoin were administered intraperitoneally at doses of 2 and 30 mg/kg  respectively  and brain and plasma concentrations were determined 60 min after administration using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 3. Although the brain uptake of phenytoin was significantly reduced following PTZ administration  no changes were observed in phenytoin disposition in the genetic absence epilepsy model. Similarly  the brain uptake of diazepam was significantly enhanced following PTZ administration  but it was not affected in absence epilepsy. 4. The cerebrovascular plasma volume (assessed by administration of the non-absorbable marker [(14)C]-inulin) was not significantly different in saline-treated compared with PTZ-treated mice and in wild-type compared with mutant R43Q mice. 5. These results demonstrate that although the brain uptake of AEDs may be altered in acute seizure models  similar changes to brain uptake may not be observed in the non-convulsive genetic absence epileptic model."

Recent studies suggest that it may regulate neurotransmission  mechanisms of which remain elusive. Here we show that NRG1  via stimulating GABA release from interneurons  inhibits pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Ablation of the NRG1 receptor ErbB4 in parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons prevented NRG1 from stimulating GABA release and from inhibiting pyramidal neurons. PV-ErbB4(-/-) mice exhibited schizophrenia-relevant phenotypes similar to those observed in NRG1 or ErbB4 null mutant mice  including hyperactivity  impaired working memory  and deficit in prepulse inhibition (PPI) that was ameliorated by diazepam  a GABA enhancer. These results indicate that NRG1 regulates the activity of pyramidal neurons by promoting GABA release from PV-positive interneurons  identifying a critical function of NRG1 in balancing brain activity. Because both NRG1 and ErbB4 are susceptibility genes of schizophrenia  our study provides insight into potential pathogenic mechanisms of schizophrenia and suggests that PV-ErbB4(-/-) mice may serve as a model in the study of this and relevant brain disorders."

The anxiety-like behavior was evaluated in mice using Vogel's conflict test (VCT)  in which number of shocks were measured. ALLO and NPYergic agents  alone or in combinations  were administered bilaterally into the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA). The intra-CeA administration of ALLO  NPY or NPY Y1/Y5 receptors agonist [Leu(31)  Pro(34)]-NPY resulted in dose-dependent increase in the number of shocks in VCT  indicating anxiolytic-like effect. However  opposite effect was observed following administration of selective NPY Y1 receptors antagonist BIBP3226. While prior administration with NPY or [Leu(31)  Pro(34)]-NPY  at the subeffective dose  potentiated the ALLO-induced anxiolytic-like effect  the same was antagonized by BIBP3226. Further  the effect of acute ALLO (30 mg/kg  intraperitoneal) on the endogenous NPY system in the CeA  ventral part of lateral division of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTLV)  nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) and arcuate nucleus (ARC) was studied with immunocytochemistry. Acute ALLO treatment significantly decreased the population of NPY-immunoreactive cells in the CeA and also in the ARC. While NPY-immunoreactive fibers were slightly increased in the AcbC and BSTLV  the cells in AcbC and fibers in ARC did not respond. We suggest that NPY may mediate ALLO induced anxiolytic-like behavior in the neuroanatomical framework of the CeA  possibly via NPY Y1 receptors."

Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) revealed that mRNA levels of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI)  which is involved in the first step of steroidogenesis and in GABAergic transmission  were increased  as were mRNA levels for several neurosteroid biosynthetic enzymes. Aromatase  17ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD17B1) and aldo-keto reductase 1C2 (AKR1C2)  were all increased in the late stages of AD. Several GABA-A subunits were significantly reduced in AD. Increased expression of aromatase in the PFC was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and was found to be localized predominantly in astrocytes. These data suggest a role for estrogens and allopregnanolone produced by astrocytes in the PFC in AD  possibly as part of a rescue program. The reduced gene expression of some synaptic and extra-synaptic GABA-A subunits may indicate a deficit of modulation of GABA-A receptors by neuroactive steroids  which may contribute to the neuropsychiatric characteristics of this disease."

In the present studies  the effects of GS39783 and CGP46381 in the modified Geller-Seifter task were assessed. First  the predictive validity of the task was confirmed by assessing the effects of multiple anxiolytic and non-anxiolytic compounds on punished and unpunished responding.METHODS: Rats were trained in the modified Geller-Seifter task. After successful acquisition of the task  chlordiazepoxide  diazepam  MPEP  haloperidol  GS39783  8-OH-DPAT  alprazolam and CGP46381 were tested consecutively. For each test compound  doses were administered in a randomized  counter-balanced  within-subjects design. Drug tests were performed only when rats exhibited baseline performance (the punished and time-out response rates were less than 10% of the unpunished response rate).RESULTS: Chlordiazepoxide  diazepam  alprazolam and MPEP released punished responding with variable effects on unpunished responding. Haloperidol had a small but significant effect on punished responding at an intermediate dose  and decreased unpunished responding at the highest dose tested. In contrast  administration of the GABA(B) receptor positive modulator GS398783 or the GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP46381 at doses up to 30 mg/kg had no effects on either punished or unpunished responding. The 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH-DPAT did not release punished responding  but significantly decreased unpunished responding at the highest dose tested.SUMMARY: The modified Geller-Seifter task generally exhibits good predictive validity for anxiolytic-like compounds. Neither GABA(B) receptor positive allosteric modulation nor blockade exhibited anxiolytic-like properties in the modified Geller-Seifter task.

Etifoxine has been shown to possess some anxiolytic-like effects in rodents.</AbstractText>: Etifoxine is an anxiolytic compound structurally unrelated to benzodiazepine and neurosteroids but potentiating GABA(A) receptor function by a dual mode of action including a direct positive allosteric modulation through a site distinct from that of benzodiazepines. Etifoxine has been shown to possess some anxiolytic-like effects in rodents.METHODS: Using the four-plate test (FPT) model of anxiety in mice the potential anxiolytic-like effect of etifoxine was first to re-evaluate. In a second part  in order to better understand the mechanism of action of etifoxine  interaction studies with 5-HT(2) ligands were performed in the FPT as mixed serotonergic and GABAergic mechanisms are highly implicated in the anxiolytic-like effect observed in the FPT.RESULTS: A dose response effect was observed for etifoxine from the dose of 40-100 mg/kg. Doses above to 60 mg/kg induced a sedative effect as was determined in the actimeter test. The 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist SR 46349B blocked the anti-punishment activity of etifoxine (40 and 50 mg/kg)  while the 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor antagonist  SB 206553 and the 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist  RS 10-2221 did not alter its effects. In a same way  only the 5-HT(2A) agonist DOI induced anti-punishment effect when co-administered with subthreshold doses of etifoxine.CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrated that etifoxine effect was modulated by 5-HT(2A) ligands co-administration. The large literature concerning GABA and 5-HT suggests that they could be co-released and could act as co-transmitters in some regions of the CNS and cross-communication between the two neurotransmitters might be an important modulator process of neuronal activity."

However  the study of serotonergic and histaminergic pathway shows that the decreased neurotransmission of serotonin and histamine in the brain reduces seizures threshold. Since  cyproheptadine interferes with these pathways via antagonizing subtypes of 5-HT(1/2) receptors and H(1) receptor  therefore the present study was undertaken to investigate its effect on seizures threshold  so as to substantiate its use in epileptics. In the present study convulsions were induced in mice by  maximum electroshock (MES)  picrotoxin  and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Cyproheptadine (4 mg/kg  i.p.) was administered per se and along with clinically used anti-epileptic drugs (phenytoin 25 mg/kg  i.p. and diazepam 5 mg/kg  i.p.) in different groups of mice  onset and extent of convulsions in these groups were compared with that of vehicle control and anti-epileptics per se treated groups. Percentage mortality in all groups was also determined. Results depicted a significant increase in duration of tonic hind limb extension in MES and decrease in latency to clonic convulsions induced by PTZ and picrotoxin in cyproheptadine treated groups (per se and along with anti-epileptics)  as compared to vehicle control and anti-epileptics per se treated groups respectively. Percentage mortality was also increased with cyproheptadine treatment. Therefore it is concluded that cyproheptadine pretreatment reduces threshold  increases severity of seizures and decreases the efficacy of clinically used anti-epileptic drugs in experimental animal models of convulsions."

Previous data have indicated that omega-3 fatty acids lead to prevention of status epilepticus-associated neuropathological changes in the hippocampal formation of rats with epilepsy. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has resulted in extensive preservation of GABAergic cells in animals with epilepsy. This study investigated the interplay of these effects with neurogenesis and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The results clearly showed a positive effect of long-term omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on brain plasticity in animals with epilepsy. Enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis and BDNF levels and preservation of interneurons expressing parvalbumin were observed. Parvalbumin-positive cells were identified as surviving instead of newly formed cells. Additional investigations are needed to determine the electrophysiological properties of the newly formed cells and to clarify whether the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on brain plasticity are accompanied by functional gain in animals with epilepsy."
"337","19939879","Social separation and diazepam withdrawal increase anxiety in the elevated plus-maze and serotonin turnover in the median raphe and hippocampus.","The present work aimed to evaluate the effects of social separation for 14 days (chronic stress) and of withdrawal from a 14-day treatment with diazepam (acute stress) on the exploratory behaviour of male rats in the elevated plus-maze and on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) turnover in different brain structures. Social separation had an anxiogenic effect  evidenced by fewer entries into  and less time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. Separation also selectively increased 5-hydroxytryptamine turnover in the hippocampus and median raphe nucleus. Diazepam withdrawal had a similar anxiogenic effect in grouped animals and increased 5-hydroxytryptamine turnover in the same brain structures. Chronic treatment with imipramine during the 14 days of separation prevented the behavioural and neurochemical changes caused by social separation. It is suggested that the increase in anxiety determined by both acute and chronic stress is mediated by the activation of the median raphe nucleus-hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine pathway."
"338","19937723","Neuronal network pharmacodynamics of GABAergic modulation in the human cortex determined using pharmaco-magnetoencephalography.","Neuronal network oscillations are a unifying phenomenon in neuroscience research  with comparable measurements across scales and species. Cortical oscillations are of central importance in the characterization of neuronal network function in health and disease and are influential in effective drug development. Whilst animal in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology is able to characterize pharmacologically induced modulations in neuronal activity  present human counterparts have spatial and temporal limitations. Consequently  the potential applications for a human equivalent are extensive. Here  we demonstrate a novel implementation of contemporary neuroimaging methods called pharmaco-magnetoencephalography. This approach determines the spatial profile of neuronal network oscillatory power change across the cortex following drug administration and reconstructs the time course of these modulations at focal regions of interest. As a proof of concept  we characterize the nonspecific GABAergic modulator diazepam  which has a broad range of therapeutic applications. We demonstrate that diazepam variously modulates theta (4-7 Hz)  alpha (7-14 Hz)  beta (15-25 Hz)  and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency oscillations in specific regions of the cortex  with a pharmacodynamic profile consistent with that of drug uptake. We examine the relevance of these results with regard to the spatial and temporal observations from other modalities and the various therapeutic consequences of diazepam and discuss the potential applications of such an approach in terms of drug development and translational neuroscience."
"339","19846710","Endocannabinoid-dependent homeostatic regulation of inhibitory synapses by miniature excitatory synaptic activities.","Homeostatic regulation of synaptic strength in response to persistent changes of neuronal activity plays an important role in maintaining the overall level of circuit activity within a normal range. Absence of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) for a few hours is known to cause upregulation of excitatory synaptic strength  suggesting that mEPSCs contribute to the maintenance of excitatory synaptic functions. In the present study  we found that the absence of mEPSCs for 1-3 h also resulted in homeostatic suppression of presynaptic functions of inhibitory synapses in acute cortical slices from juvenile rats  as suggested by the reduced frequency (but not amplitude) of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) as well as the reduced amplitude of IPSCs. This homeostatic regulation depended on endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling  because blockade of either the activation of cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs) or the synthesis of its endogenous ligand 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) abolished the suppression of inhibitory synapses caused by the absence of mEPSCs. Blockade of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR-I) also abolished the suppression of inhibitory synapses  consistent with the mGluR-I requirement for eCB synthesis and release in cortical synapses. Furthermore  this homeostatic regulation also required eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2)-dependent protein synthesis  but not gene transcription. Activation of eEF2 alone was sufficient to suppress the mIPSC frequency  an effect abolished by inhibiting CB1Rs. Thus  mEPSCs contribute to the maintenance of inhibitory synaptic function and the absence of mEPSCs results in presynaptic suppression of inhibitory synapses via protein synthesis-dependent elevation of eCB signaling."

(ilama) extracts and palmitone on rat amygdala kindling.","Annonas are consumed as fresh fruits  but  because of their effects on the central nervous system  are also used in folk medicine. The effect on rat amygdala kindling of repeated administration of Annona diversifolia hexane (100mg/kg IP or PO) and ethanol (100mg/kg  PO) leaf extracts and palmitone (10mg/kg  IP) was determined. Electrographic and/or behavioral changes were monitored during kindling-induced seizures 60minutes after treatments. Antiepileptic efficacy was evaluated with respect to afterdischarge (AD) duration  spike frequency  and/or behavioral seizure activity. Oral administration of both extracts significantly decreased spike frequency  whereas intraperitoneally administered hexane extract and palmitone only reduced AD duration. Hexane extract and palmitone exhibited anticonvulsant properties and delayed establishment of a kindling state as observed with diazepam (0.3mg/kg IP). These results reinforce the anticonvulsant properties of this plant  and palmitone and other constituents are responsible for the pharmacological effects."
"341","19811773","Early-life blockade of 5-HT(1A) receptors alters adult anxiety behavior and benzodiazepine sensitivity.","BACKGROUND: Early-life stress may affect 5-HT(1A) receptor circuitry  which could result in increased anxiety in later life. An increased anxiety phenotype in 5-HT(1A) receptor KO mice (1AKO) mice has been ascribed to 5-HT(1A) receptor absence during the early postnatal period. Thus  subtle and transient serotonergic changes during the early postnatal period may lead to an increased risk for developing stress-related disorders during adulthood.METHODS: Wildtype and 1AKO mice on a Swiss-Webster (SW) background were treated during the early postnatal period with vehicle or the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100 635.RESULTS: Pharmacologic 5-HT(1A) receptor blockade during the early postnatal period induced long-lasting effects on anxiety and benzodiazepine sensitivity in adolescent and adult mice on a Swiss-Webster background and resembles the SW 1AKO phenotype. Furthermore  WAY-100 635-treated mice had increased cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor (GABA(A)R) alpha(1) and alpha(3) subunit levels and increased hippocampal GABA(A)R alpha(2) subunit levels.CONCLUSIONS: Absence of 5-HT(1A)R signaling during early stages of brain maturation predisposes an organism to affective dysfunction later in life. Because early-life treatment with WAY-100 635 in Swiss-Webster mice reduced diazepam sensitivity and increased GABA(A)R alpha subunit levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus  our data suggest a putative link between early-life disruption of the serotonergic system and the emergence of increased anxiety and decreased benzodiazepine responsivity at adult age. Moreover  early-life 5-HT(1A) receptor functionality appears to be essential for the development of normal GABA(A)R functionality. This study may have clinical implications for psychoactive drug use during pregnancy and for the pharmacogenetic background of benzodiazepine sensitivity."
"342","19804380","Relative positioning of diazepam in the benzodiazepine-binding-pocket of GABA receptors.","GABA(A) receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Some of them are targets of benzodiazepines that are widely used in clinical practice for their sedative/hypnotic  anxiolytic  muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant effects. In order to rationally separate these different drug actions  we need to understand the interaction of such compounds with the benzodiazepine-binding pocket. With this aim  we mutated residues located in the benzodiazepine-binding site individually to cysteine. These mutated receptors were combined with benzodiazepine site ligands carrying a cysteine reactive group in a defined position. Proximal apposition of reaction partners will lead to a covalent reaction. We describe here such proximity-accelerated chemical coupling reactions of alpha(1)S205C and alpha(1)T206C with a diazepam derivative modified at the C-3 position with a reactive isothiocyanate group (-NCS). We also provide new data that identify alpha(1)H101C and alpha(1)N102C as exclusive sites of the reaction of a diazepam derivative where the -Cl atom is replaced by a -NCS group. Based on these observations we propose a relative positioning of diazepam within the benzodiazepine-binding site of alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) receptors."
"343","19786076","Neuropeptides modulate compound postsynaptic potentials in basolateral amygdala.","Previous behavioral studies have shown that neuropeptides intrinsic to the amygdala formation can alter fear and anxiety states. We have previously shown that the anxiogenic neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) increases inhibitory neurotransmission in basolateral amygdala. We have since observed that CCK induces synchronized rhythmic activity composed of compound postsynaptic potentials (cPSPs). We have now further characterized these cPSPs by inducing cPSPs routinely in 5 mM extracellular K(+). CCK facilitated cPSP occurrence in a dose dependent manner in brain slices from both young and mature rats. The cPSPs were attenuated by glutamate receptor antagonists (NBQX or DL-AP5) or low concentrations of GABA(A) receptor antagonists (bicuculline methiodide (BMI)  SR95531  or picrotoxin)  but not by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist  CGP52432. Low concentrations of tetrodotoxin (TTX  10 nM) also attenuated the cPSPs. The Na-K-2Cl cotransporter blocker  bumetanide (1 or 10 microM) also blocked the cPSPs. The anxiogenic neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) facilitated cPSPs while anxiolytic neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y (NPY) and somatostatin) attenuated cPSPs. The benzodiazepine agonist diazepam dose-dependently modulated cPSPs. Mefloquine facilitated cPSPs within 10 min of application. We hypothesize that cPSPs are generated by positive feedback between a subset of interneurons and a subset of glutamatergic projection neurons."

Recently  some studies have suggested that the treatment with benzodiazepines could have different efficacy in depressed patients as opposed to non-depressed ones. To clarify the matter  a study is currently underway  regarding the drug metabolism in rats. In order to obtain a more complete and significant set of data  the main diazepam metabolites have also been considered  namely: nordiazepam  temazepam and oxazepam. A feasible and reliable HPLC method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of these compounds in plasma and brain tissue of rats. The method has been applied to &quot;normal&quot; rats and to genetic rat models of depression in order to estimate drug metabolism in different breeds. Analyte separation was achieved on a C8 reversed phase column using an acidic phosphate buffer/acetonitrile mixture as the mobile phase. The detection wavelength was 238 nm. An original sample pre-treatment  based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) was developed in order to eliminate endogenous interference  using only 250 microL of matrix (brain homogenate or plasma) for a complete analysis. The method has been validated with good results in terms of precision  extraction yield  sensitivity  selectivity and accuracy on both matrices and has been successfully applied to samples from some rats subjected to the preliminary study.

While infusion of cold normal saline is a simple and inexpensive method for reducing core temperature  human cold-defense mechanisms potentially make this route stressful or ineffective. We hypothesized that intravenous administration of diazepam during a rapid infusion of 30 mL.kg-1 of cold (4 degrees C) 0.9% saline to healthy subjects would be more comfortable and reduce core body temperature more than the administration of cold saline alone. Fifteen subjects received rapidly infused cold (4 degrees C) 0.9% saline. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive  intravenously  20 mg diazepam (HIGH)  10 mg diazepam (LOW)  or placebo (CON). Main outcomes were core temperature  skin temperature  and oxygen consumption. Data for the main outcomes were analyzed with generalized estimating equations to identify differences in group  time  or a group x time interaction. Core temperature decreased in all groups (CON  1.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C; LOW  1.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C; HIGH  1.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C)  while skin temperature was unchanged. Mean (95% CI) oxygen consumption was 315.3 (253.8  376.9) mL.kg-1.min-1 in the CON group  317.9 (275.5  360.3) in the LOW group  and 226.1 (216.4  235.9) in the HIGH group. Significant time and group x time interaction was observed for core temperature and oxygen consumption (p &lt; 0.001). Administration of high-dose diazepam resulted in decreased oxygen consumption during cold saline infusion  suggesting that 20 mg of intravenous diazepam may reduce the shivering threshold without compromising respiratory or cardiovascular function."

The intoxication with anticholinergics and benzodiazepines tend to produce neurodegeneration which cause memory deficits. Our earlier reports have shown the antiamnesic drug  B. monniera to be capable of alleviating diazepam induced memory deficits. We have now tested how scopolamine affects downstream signaling molecules of long term potentiation and if B. monniera can also modulate the scopolamine induced amnesia. We used Morris water maze scale to test the amnesic effect of scopolamine and its reversal by B. monniera. Rota-rod test was used to screen muscle coordination activity of mice before water maze investigations were carried out. The results showed that scopolamine downregulated protein kinase C and iNOS without affecting cAMP  protein kinase A  calmodulin  MAP kinase  nitrite  CREB and pCREB. B. monniera reversed the scopolamine induced amnesia by significantly improving calmodulin and by partially attenuating protein kinase C and pCREB. These observations suggest involvement of calmodulin in evoking antiamnesic effects of B. monniera."

In DRN slices from unstressed rats  nociceptin/orphanin FQ concentration-dependently inhibited the firing rate of putative 5HT neurons (EC(50) = 21.6 +/- 1.21 nM) and the selective NOP receptor antagonist UFP-101 shifted the concentration-response curve to the right (estimated pA(2) 6.86). Nociceptin/orphanin FQ potency was enhanced in slices prepared from rats previously subjected to a 15 min swim stress (EC(50) = 1.98 +/- 0.11 nM). Swim stress did not change the number or affinity of NOP receptors in DRN. Stress-elicited potentiation involved corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)(1) receptors  GABA signaling and protein synthesis  being attenuated by pre-treatment with antalarmin (20 mg/kg  i.p.)  diazepam (2.4 mg/kg  i.p.) and cycloheximide (2.5 mg/kg  i.p.)  respectively. In anesthetized unstressed rats  locally applied nociceptin/orphanin FQ (0.03 and 0.1 ng/30 nl) inhibited the firing rate of DRN neurons (to 80 +/- 7 and 54 +/- 10% of baseline  respectively). Nociceptin/orphanin FQ inhibition was potentiated both 24 h after swim stress and 1 h after CRF (30 ng/30 nl intra-DRN). Stress-induced potentiation was prevented by the selective CRF(1) receptor antagonist  NBI 30755 (20 mg/kg  i.p.). In contrast  the inhibitory response of DRN neurons to the 5HT(1A) agonist  8OH-DPAT (1 microg/1 microl  intra-DRN) was not potentiated by swim stress  ruling out a non-specific enhanced permeability of GIRK channel. Together  these findings suggest that CRF and the nociceptin/orphanin FQ/NOP system interact in the DRN during stress to control 5HT transmission; this may play a role in stress-related neuropsychopathologies."

Many cells spontaneously fired action potentials at a rate proportional to the level of neuronal depolarization. The reversal potential for GABA-activated currents  assessed by cell-attached single channel recordings  was close to the resting membrane potential. All spontaneously firing neurons recorded in cell-attached mode or imaged with biphoton microscopy were inhibited by GABA. Spontaneous epileptiform activity in the form of recurrent population bursts was suppressed by glutamate receptor antagonists  the GABA(A) receptor agonist isoguvacine  and the positive allosteric GABA(A) modulator diazepam. Blockade of GABA(A) receptors aggravated spontaneous epileptiform activity. The NKCC1 antagonist bumetanide had little effect on epileptiform activity.INTERPRETATION: SWS cortical neurons have a relatively depolarized resting membrane potential and spontaneously fire action potentials that may contribute to increased network excitability. In contrast to previous data depicting excitatory and proconvulsive actions of GABA in certain pediatric and adult epilepsies  GABA plays mainly an inhibitory and anticonvulsive role in SWS pediatric cortex."

Furthermore  we studied the hippocampal synaptic plasticity and anatomical expression of Arc protein during withdrawal and the re-exposure to the context associated with anxiety expression (characteristic sign of benzodiazepines withdrawal). It was demonstrated that re-exposure evoked on days 15 and 25 after the first exposure the same behavior. An increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity  expressed as a lower threshold to induce long-term potentiation on dentate gyrus  was observed in animals dependent on diazepam and during retrieval  in the same group  until day 15.

"351","19703932","Protein interactions involving the gamma2 large cytoplasmic loop of GABA(A) receptors modulate conductance.","Native GABA(A) channels display a single-channel conductance ranging between approximately 10 and 90 pS. Diazepam increases the conductance of some of these native channels but never those of recombinant receptors  unless they are coexpressed with GABARAP. This trafficking protein clusters recombinant receptors in the membrane  suggesting that high-conductance channels arise from receptors that are at locally high concentrations. The amphipathic (MA) helix that is present in the large cytoplasmic loop of every subunit of all ligand-gated ion channels mediates protein-protein interactions. Here we report that when applied to inside-out patches  a peptide mimicking the MA helix of the gamma2 subunit (gamma(381-403)) of the GABA(A) receptor abrogates the potentiating effect of diazepam on both endogenous receptors and recombinant GABA(A) receptors coexpressed with GABARAP  by substantially reducing their conductance. The protein interaction disrupted by the peptide did not involve GABARAP  because a shorter peptide (gamma(386-403)) known to compete with the gamma2-GABARAP interaction did not affect the conductance of recombinant alphabetagamma receptors coexpressed with GABARAP. The requirement for receptor clustering and the fact that the gamma2 MA helix is able to self-associate support a mechanism whereby adjacent GABA(A) receptors interact via their gamma2-subunit MA helices  altering ion permeation through each channel. Alteration of ion-channel function arising from dynamic interactions between ion channels of the same family has not been reported previously and highlights a novel way in which inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain may be differentially modulated."
"352","19695310","Ethanol modulates mammalian circadian clock phase resetting through extrasynaptic GABA receptor activation.","Ethanol modulates the actions of multiple neurotransmitter systems  including GABA. However  its enhancing effects on GABA signaling typically are seen only at high concentrations. In contrast  although GABA is a prominent neurotransmitter in the circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)  we see ethanol modulation of clock phase resetting at low concentrations (&lt;50 mM). A possible explanation is that ethanol enhances GABAergic signaling in the SCN through activating GABA(A) receptors that contain the delta subunit (GABA(Adelta) receptors)  which are sensitive to low ethanol concentrations. Therefore  we investigated whether ethanol acts on GABA(Adelta) receptors in the SCN. Here we show that acute application of the GABA(Adelta) receptor antagonist  RO15-4513  to mouse hypothalamic slices containing the SCN prevents ethanol inhibition of nighttime glutamate-induced (photic-like) phase delays of the circadian clock. Diazepam  which enhances activity of GABA(A) receptors containing the gamma subunit (GABA(Agamma) receptors)  does not modulate these phase shifts. Moreover  we find that RO15-4513 prevents ethanol enhancement of daytime serotonergic (non-photic) phase advances of the circadian clock. Furthermore  diazepam phase-advances the SCN circadian clock when applied alone in the daytime  while ethanol has no effect by itself at that time. These data support the hypothesis that ethanol acts on GABA(Adelta) receptors in the SCN to modulate photic and non-photic circadian clock phase resetting. They also reveal distinct modulatory roles of different GABA(A) receptor subtypes in circadian clock phase regulation."

Therefore  by using recently developed high affinity  selective TSPO ligands in conjunction with functional imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET)  it becomes possible to study the process of microglial activation in the living brain.

In this study we investigated whether morphine dependence was inhibited by phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitors rolipram and diazepam. Dependence on morphine was induced by a 7-day s.c. implantation of morphine pellets. On day 8  morphine withdrawal was precipitated by an injection of naloxone. In order to determine the effect of rolipram and diazepam rats were injected with these drugs once daily for seven days as well as 30 min before of naloxone injection. When opioid withdrawal was precipitated  an enhanced noradrenaline turnover and increased level of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were observed 30 min after naloxone administration. Moreover  c-Fos expression was induced in the PVN after naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. Co-administration of rolipram or diazepam with morphine during the pre-treatment period  significantly reduced the signs of withdrawal  the enhancement of noradrenaline turnover and the increase in cyclic AMP. However  these inhibitors did not modify either levels of cyclic GMP or c-Fos expression in the PVN. These findings demonstrate that co-administration of rolipram or diazepam with morphine attenuate the withdrawal syndrome and suggest that these compounds may prevent the up-regulation of the cyclic AMP pathway and the associated increase in cyclic AMP level in morphine-withdrawn rats."

Compounds (2-10) evaluated in vitro were potent 5-HT(1A) receptor ligands. Preclinical studies indicated that 8-[3-(N4-phenyl)-piperazin-N1-yl-propyl]-1 3-dimethyl-(1H 8H)-imidazo[2 1-f]purine-2 4-dione (2) exerts anxiolytic-like activity in the four-plate test in mice; however its effect was weaker  than that produced by Diazepam. This compound and 8-[3-(N4-2'-metoxyphenyl)-piperazin-N1-yl-propyl]-1 3-dimethyl-(1H 8H)-imidazo[2 1-f]purine-2 4-dione (3) behaved like antidepressants in the forced swimming test in mice; and their activity in that model was comparable with the effect of Imipramine. The obtained results suggested that the long-chain arylpiperazines (LCAPs) linked to tricyclic derivatives of the theophylline remain a worthy of future research for obtaining new derivatives with potential anxiolytic/antidepressant activity."
"356","19674049","The impact of diazepam's discovery on the treatment and understanding of status epilepticus.","The fortuitous discovery of the benzodiazepines and the subsequent application of these agents to the treatment of status epilepticus (SE) heralds in the modern age of treating this neurologic emergency. More than 50 years after their discovery  the benzodiazepines remain the drugs of first choice in the treatment of SE. However  the benzodiazepines can be ineffective  especially in those patients whose seizures are the most prolonged. The benzodiazepines act by increasing the affinity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for GABAA receptors. A receptor's subunit composition affects its functional and pharmacologic properties  trafficking  and cellular localization. The GABAA receptors that mediate synaptic inhibition typically contain a gamma2 subunit and are diazepam-sensitive. Among the GABAA receptors that mediate tonic inhibition are the benzodiazepine-insensitive delta subunit-containing receptors. The initial studies investigating the pathogenesis of SE demonstrated that a reduction in GABA-mediated inhibition within the hippocampus was important in maintenance of SE  and this reduction correlated with a rapid modification in the postsynaptic GABAA receptor population expressed on the surface of the hippocampal principal neurons. Subsequent studies found that this rapid modification is  in part  mediated by an activity-dependent  subunit-specific trafficking of the receptors that resulted in the reduction in the surface expression of the benzodiazepine-sensitive gamma2 subunit-containing receptors and the preserved surface expression of the benzodiazepine-insensitive delta subunit-containing receptors. This improved understanding of the changes in the trafficking of GABAA receptors during SE partially accounts for the development of benzodiazepine-pharmacoresistance and has implications for the current and future treatment of benzodiazepine-refractory SE."

Despite common emotional symptoms in AD such as anxiety and fear are associated with a more rapid cognitive decline  the pathological mechanisms involved in these behavioral changes remain largely elusive. In this study  we examined the pathological mechanisms of emotional behavior in well-established AD transgenic mice expressing human mutant beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein (APP(Ind) and APP(Sw Ind)) and tau (3xTg-AD).METHODS: We evaluated unconditioned and conditioned fear-induced freezing behavior and spatial memory in APP(Ind)  APP(Sw Ind)  and 3xTg-AD transgenic mice. The Abeta and tau pathologies and signaling pathways involved in emotional processing were studied by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting analyses.RESULTS: The APP(Ind)/APP(Sw Ind) and 3xTg-AD transgenic mice displayed at early ages enhanced innate and conditioned fear symptoms and spatial memory deficits coinciding with enhanced accumulation of Abeta in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic neurons  respectively  of the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Similarly  the number of neurons with intraneuronal Abeta40 and Abeta42 was significantly increased in the BLA of human AD brains. Fear responses might reflect an influence of anxiety  because the anxiolytic compounds valproate  diazepam  and buspirone reduced efficiently unconditioned and conditioned fear responses in APP transgenic mice. In addition  phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2  which is critical for acquisition and consolidation of fear conditioning  was increased in the amygdala of APP transgenic mice after cued conditioning.CONCLUSIONS: We propose a deleterious role of intraneuronal Abeta on amygdala-dependent emotional responses by affecting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling pathway."

Eighteen genes code for GABA(A)R subunits  but little is known about the epsilon subunit. Our aim was to identify the synaptic transmission properties displayed by native receptors incorporating epsilon. Immunogold localization detected epsilon at synaptic sites on locus coeruleus (LC) neurons. In situ hybridization revealed prominent signals from epsilon  and mRNAs  some low beta1 and beta3 signals  and no gamma signal. Using in vivo extracellular and in vitro patch-clamp recordings in LC  we established that neuron firing rates  GABA-activated currents  and mIPSC charge were insensitive to the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam (FLU)  in agreement with the characteristics of recombinant receptors including an epsilon subunit. Surprisingly  LC provided binding sites for benzodiazepines  and GABA-induced currents were potentiated by diazepam (DZP) in the micromolar range. A number of GABA(A)R ligands significantly potentiated GABA-induced currents  and zinc ions were only active at concentrations above 1 muM  further indicating that receptors were not composed of only alpha and beta subunits  but included an epsilon subunit. In contrast to recombinant receptors including an epsilon subunit  GABA(A)R in LC showed no agonist-independent opening. Finally  we determined that mIPSCs  as well as ensemble currents induced by ultra-fast GABA application  exhibited surprisingly slow rise times. Our work thus defines the signature of native GABA(A)R with a subunit composition including epsilon: differential sensitivity to FLU and DZP and slow rise time of currents. We further propose that alpha(3 ) beta(1/3 ) and epsilon subunits compose GABA(A)R in LC."

The aim of this study was to observe the increase in cerebral accumulation of N-isopropyl-p-(123)I-iodoamphetamine ((123)I-IMP) using the protein-binding displacement method with amino acid infusion.METHODS: (123)I-IMP binding to human serum was investigated and identified. In addition  protein-binding sites and the specific binding sites of human serum albumin (HSA) and alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP) were examined by ultrafiltration. Then  serum-binding sites and the displacement effects of amino acid infusion  including Proteamin 12X Injection and Kidomin  were confirmed in vitro. Subsequently  displacement of (123)I-IMP serum protein binding with Proteamin amino acid infusion was tested in monkeys. A scintigraphic study of (123)I-IMP in monkeys loaded with or without Proteamin was performed  and time-activity-curves of (123)I-IMP brain accumulation in monkeys were evaluated.RESULTS: (123)I-IMP was bound to HSA site II and AGP to nearly equal extents. Compared with control conditions  loading with Proteamin and Kidomin markedly increased free fractions of binding site markers for HSA site II ((14)C-diazepam: 0.95% +/- 0.04% for control  1.40% +/- 0.06% for Proteamin  1.62% +/- 0.05% for Kidomin) and AGP ((3)H-propranolol: 10.60% +/- 0.32% for control  13.18% +/- 0.14% for Proteamin  13.82% +/- 0.72% for Kidomin). Amino acid infusions were thus suitable for use as displacers for binding site II and AGP. With use of Proteamin amino acid infusion to displace protein binding  the free fraction of (125)I-IMP (14.95% +/- 0.74%) was significantly increased in serum (19.24% +/- 0.87%). In a (123)I-IMP scintigraphic study of monkeys  average cerebral uptake in 2 monkeys increased by 1.34-fold with Proteamin. Our findings suggested that Proteamin treatment increased the free fraction of (123)I-IMP  yielding rapid and pronounced cerebral accumulation in vivo.CONCLUSION: Amino acid infusion can improve brain accumulation by competitive displacement of serum protein binding in vivo. Further similar studies are needed with other radiopharmaceuticals."

Using pharmacological  immunohistochemical and analytical approaches  we investigated the response of dopamine D(3) receptor null (D3R((-/-))) mice in models of epilepsy and anxiety  in relation to their brain endocannabinoid and endovanilloid tone. Compared to wild-type mice  D3R((-/-)) mice exhibited a delayed onset of clonic seizures  enhanced survival time  reduced mortality rate and more sensitivity to anticonvulsant effects of diazepam after intraperitoneal administration of picrotoxin (7 mg/kg)  and a less anxious-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze test. D3R((-/-)) mice also exhibited different endocannabinoid and TRPV1  but not CB(1)  levels in the hippocampus  nucleus accumbens  amygdala and striatum. Given the role played by CB(1) and TRPV1 in neuroprotection and anxiety  and based on data obtained here with pharmacological tools  we suggest that the alterations of endocannabinoid and endovanilloid tone found in D3R((-/-)) mice might account for part of their altered responses to excitotoxic and anxiogenic stimuli."

Saline  isopulegol or diazepam were intraperitonealy injected 30 min before PTZ. The latency for development of convulsions and mortality  as well as the mortality protection percentage was recorded. For investigating the involvement of GABAergic system  flumazenil was utilized. The activity of antioxidant enzyme catalase as well as the levels of reduced glutathione and lipid peroxidation were measured in brain hippocampus. Similarly to diazepam  isopulegol significantly prolonged the latency for convulsions and mortality of mice. All animals were protected against mortality at higher dose of isopulegol. Flumazenil pretreatment decreased the prolongation of seizure latency induced by both diazepam and isopulegol  although it was not able to reverse the latency and protection percent for mortality. Isopulegol also significantly prevented PTZ-induced increase in lipid peroxidation  preserved catalase activity in normal levels  and prevented the PTZ-induced loss of GSH in hippocampus of mice. These results suggest that the anticonvulsant and bioprotective effects of isopulegol against PTZ-induced convulsions are possibly related to positive modulation of benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors and to antioxidant properties."

The goals of this study were: (1) to identify GABA(A) receptor subunits in the carotid body (CB) and petrosal ganglion (PG); (2) to test if BZs exert their effects through the GABA(A) receptor in the CB chemosensory unit. Tissues were taken from euthanized adult cats. RNA was extracted from the brain  and cDNA sequences of several GABA(A) receptor subunits were determined. Subsequent RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the gene expression of alpha2  alpha3  beta3  and gamma2 subunits in the CB and the PG. Immunoreactivity for GABA and for GABA(A) receptor beta3 and gamma2 subunits was detected in chemosensory glomus cells (GCs) in the CB and neurons in the PG. The functional aspects of the GABA-GABA(A) receptor system in the CB was studied by measuring CB neural output using in vitro perfusion setup. Two BZs  midazolam and diazepam  decreased the CB neural response to hypoxia. With continuous application of bicuculline  a GABA(A) receptor antagonist  the effects of BZs were abolished. In conclusion  the GABA-GABA(A) receptor system is functioning in the CB chemosensory system. BZs inhibit CB neural response to hypoxia by enhancing GABA(A) receptor activity."

Sprague-Dawley rat pups at 10 days were used to measure numbers and frequencies of the ultrasonic vocalizations under various ambient temperatures and with pharmacological manipulations of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and GABAergic systems. The ultrasonic vocalization consisted of two distinct peaks in the frequency range of 30 kHz to 50 kHz. The area under the curve (AUC) in the high-frequency range and the number of the ultrasonic vocalizations increased when ambient temperature was lowered. Systemic administration of a selective CRF1 receptor antagonist  NBI27914  and a typical anxiolytic  diazepam  decreased the AUC in the high-frequency range and the number of the ultrasonic vocalizations in a dose-dependent manner at an ambient temperature of 24 degrees C. The AUC in the low-frequency range did not change with an alteration in ambient temperature or treatment with NBI27914 and diazepam except a high dose (1 mg/kg) of diazepam. These results demonstrated that emotional levels of isolated pups reflected not only the number but also the frequency distribution of maternal separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. High-frequency components  but not low-frequency components  of the ultrasonic vocalization were sensitive to changes in negative affective state of isolated pups."

Regional perfusion flow rate varied 7.5-fold  and capillary density (based on vascular volume) varied 3.7-fold  across the 13 brain regions examined. The rate of regional flow  as well as P-gp-mediated colchicine efflux activity  was directly proportional to local capillary density. A decrease in perfusion rate attenuated verapamil brain uptake and had significant effect on P-gp-mediated efflux activity for this substrate in brain regions with lower capillary density. Regional brain uptake and calculated logD at pH 7.4 (clogD(7.4)) were well-related in P-gp-deficient mice  indicating that in the absence of P-gp-mediated efflux  physicochemical properties of the compound (i.e.  lipophilicity) serve as the primary determinant of regional brain uptake. Loperamide regional brain uptake and P-gp effect during a 60-s brain perfusion or at 30min after subcutaneous administration were significantly correlated with local capillary density. The highest P-gp-mediated efflux activity was consistently observed in cerebral cortex and midbrain regions for loperamide following short-term brain perfusion and at all time points following subcutaneous administration. These results in intact animal emphasize that the regionality of substrate exposure in brain as measured by the in situ brain perfusion technique is actually biologically relevant."

Structure-activity relationship and efficacy in the treatment of poisoning with organophosphorus compounds.","During more than five decades  pyridinium oximes have been developed as therapeutic agents used in the medical treatment of poisoning with organophosphorus compounds. Their mechanism of action is reactivation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibited by organophosphorus agents. Organophosphorus compounds (OPC) are used as pesticides and developed as warfare nerve agents such as tabun  soman  sarin  VX and others. Exposure to even small amounts of an OPC can be fatal and death is usually caused by respiratory failure resulting from paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles  depression of the brain respiratory center  bronchospasm  and excessive bronchial secretions. The mechanism of OPC poisoning involves phosphorylation of the serine hydroxyl group at the active site of AChE leading to the inactivation of this essential enzyme  which has an important role in neurotransmission. AChE inhibition results in the accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptor sites  producing continuous stimulation of cholinergic fibers throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Presently  a combination of an antimuscarinic agent  e.g. atropine  AChE reactivator such as one of the standard pyridinium oximes (pralidoxime  trimedoxime  obidoxime  HI-6) and diazepam has been used for the treatment of organophosphate poisoning in humans. Despite enormous efforts devoted to synthesis and development of new pyridinium oximes as potential antidotes against poisoning with OPC  only four compounds have found their application in human medicine so far. However  they differ in their activity in poisoning with warfare nerve agents and pesticides and there is still no universal broad-spectrum oxime capable of protecting against all known OPC. In this article  we review data on structure-activity relationship of pyridinium oximes and discuss their pharmacological and toxicological significance."

Microemulsions of Diazepam (DME)  Lorazepam (LME) and Alprazolam (AME) were prepared by titration method and characterized for drug content  globule size distribution and zeta potential  nasal toxicity and sleep induction. DME  LME and AME were transparent and stable with mean globule size and zeta potential in the range of 95.6 nm to 141.7 nm and -2.205 to -0.111 mV respectively. The prepared microemulsions exhibited reversible nasal toxicity. Onset of sleep and duration of sleep were observed in the following order: Lorazepam &gt; Alprazolam&gt;Diazepam. Faster onset of sleep following intranasal administration of microemulsions (&lt;20 min) compared to oral administration (29-33 min) and control group (&gt;45 min) for all three drugs suggested selective nose-to-brain transport of drug(s). Intranasal administration of microemulsion based formulations resulted in even faster onset of sleep (&lt;12 min) with intranasal mucoadhesive microemulsion(s) resulting in fastest onset of sleep (&lt;9 min). Duration of sleep was longest with the intranasal mucoadhesive microemulsions. These results are suggestive of larger extent of distribution of drug(s) to brain after intranasal administration of mucoadhesive microemulsion(s). These results are further corroborated with by loss or rightening reflex and startle reflex at earlier time points (within 10 min and 15 min respectively) with mucoadhesive microemulsions. Thus  the results of this investigation indicated rapid and larger extent of drug transport to the rat brain resulting in rapid induction of sleep followed by prolonged duration of sleep in rats following intranasal administration of mucoadhesive microemulsion(s).

The sample consisted of 202 former severe heroin addicts in methadone treatment and 167 healthy controls with no history of drug abuse. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  haplotype and multi-SNP genotype pattern analyses were performed. Seventeen SNPs showed point-wise significant association with heroin addiction (nominal P&lt; 0.01).

Clinically relevant GABA(A) receptor subtypes are assembled from alpha5(1-3  5)  beta1-3 and the gamma2 subunit. They exhibit a stoichiometry of two alpha  two beta and one gamma subunit  with two GABA binding sites located at the alpha/beta and one benzodiazepine binding site located at the alpha/gamma subunit interface. Introduction of the H105R point mutation into the alpha5 subunit  to render alpha5 subunit-containing receptors insensitive to the clinically important benzodiazepine site agonist diazepam  unexpectedly resulted in a reduced level of alpha5 subunit protein in alpha5(H105R) mice. In this study  we show that the alpha5(H105R) mutation did not affect cell surface expression and targeting of the receptors or their assembly into macromolecular receptor complexes but resulted in a severe reduction of alpha5-selective ligand binding. Immunoprecipitation studies suggest that the diminished alpha5-selective binding is presumably due to a repositioning of the alpha5(H105R) subunit in GABA(A) receptor complexes containing two different alpha subunits. These findings imply an important role of histidine 105 in determining the position of the alpha5 subunit within the receptor complex by determining the affinity for assembly with the gamma2 subunit."

The action of the GAT inhibitor SKF89976A on the expression of these mRNAs  and on open field behaviour was subsequently observed.RESULTS: The results show an unexpected sedative effect of GAT-inhibition in diazepam-tolerant rats. The expression data show a significant effect of diazepam treatment on synaptophysin expression  which is reversible by SKF89976A treatment.CONCLUSIONS: The increased synaptophysin expression in the hippocampus of diazepam-tolerant rats may indicate a role for modulation of transmitter release  synaptic plasticity and learning in pharmacological tolerance. The reversibility of this effect following acute GAT inhibition suggests a complicated relationship between the benzodiazepine-binding site and other synaptic GABA-binding sites. Furthermore  the sedative behavioural effect of the GAT inhibitor in diazepam-tolerant rats is an unusual observation with implications for the treatment of drug-tolerant individuals."

Mechanical capillary depletion of brain homogenates showed that less than 10% of [(14)C]-DHA or [(14)C]-EPA remained in endothelial cells of the brain vasculature  demonstrating that both molecules fully crossed the BBB. Addition of bovine serum albumin decreased the Clup of [(14)C]-DHA to 0.6+/-0.3microlg(-1)s(-1)  indicating that binding to albumin reduced importantly  but not totally  the passage of DHA through the BBB. The Clup of [(14)C]-DHA or [(14)C]-EPA was not saturable at concentration up to 100microM  suggesting that these compounds crossed the BBB by simple diffusion. However  long-term high-DHA dietary consumption reduced the Clup of [(14)C]-DHA to 33+/-6microlg(-1)s(-1) (-20%  p&lt;0.01). These results confirm that the brain uptake of DHA or EPA perfused with a physiological buffer is comparable to highly diffusible drugs like diazepam  and can be modulated by albumin binding and chronic dietary DHA intake."

Equivalent hypothermia induced and maintained in animals after ischemia did not prevent neuronal cell loss to the same extent as diazepam did (42.8+/-9.2% and 72.4+/-14.5% of live neurons  respectively). In vitro  under constant temperature conditions  diazepam exerted neuroprotective effects following a &quot;U-shaped&quot; dose-response curve  with concentration efficacy window of 0.5-10 microM. Five micro-molar diazepam showed significant protection by reducing over 50% the number of (dead) propidium iodide labeled cells even in the presence of GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline. Next  we have shown that diazepam reduced the efflux of cytochrome c out of mitochondria both in compromised CA1 neurons in vitro and in isolated mitochondria treated with 30 microM THB. Our results suggest that the neuroprotective action of diazepam relies on additional mechanism(s) and not solely on its hypothermic effect. We suggest that diazepam evokes neuroprotection through its central receptors located on the GABA(A) receptor complex and  possibly  through its peripheral receptor  the translocator protein TSPO (previously called the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) located in the outer mitochondrial membrane."
"375","19428632","An anxiety-like phenotype in mice selectively bred for aggression.","Using selective bi-directional breeding procedures  two different lines of mice were developed. The NC900 line is highly reactive and attacks their social partners without provocation  whereas aggression in NC100 animals is uncommon in social environments. The enhanced reactivity of NC900 mice suggests that emotionality may have been selected with aggression. As certain forms of anxiety promote exaggerated defensive responses  we tested NC900 mice for the presence of an anxiety-like phenotype. In the open field  light-dark exploration  and zero maze tests  NC900 mice displayed anxiety-like responses. These animals were less responsive to the anxiolytic actions of diazepam in the zero maze than NC100 animals; diazepam also reduced the reactivity and attack behaviors of NC900 mice. The NC900 mice had reduced diazepam-sensitive GABA(A) receptor binding in brain regions associated with aggression and anxiety. Importantly  there was a selective reduction in levels of the GABA(A) receptor alpha(2) subunit protein in NC900 frontal cortex and amygdala; no changes in alpha(1) or gamma(2) subunit proteins were observed. These findings suggest that reductions in the alpha(2) subunit protein in selected brain regions may underlie the anxiety and aggressive phenotype of NC900 mice. Since anxiety and aggression are comorbid in certain psychiatric conditions  such as borderline personality and posttraumatic stress disorder  investigations with NC900 mice may provide new insights into basic mechanisms that underlie these and related psychiatric conditions."
"376","19427535","Anxiolytics antagonize yohimbine-induced central noradrenergic activity: a concomitant in vivo voltammetry-electrophysiology model of anxiety.","It has been shown that increased cerebral noradrenergic activity is closely related to anxiety-related behaviours. Furthermore  the noradrenergic alpha-2 receptor antagonist yohimbine (YOH) increases noradrenaline- (NA) cell firing and release in discrete brain areas involved in the modulation of anxiety such as the locus coeruleus (LC) and amygdala (AMY). In addition  YOH is highly anxiogenic in both humans and laboratory animals. Here we used an in vivo dual methodology to measure concomitantly the extracellular levels of catecholamines in AMY with voltammetry and the cell firing rate in LC with field electrophysiology in anaesthetized rats to characterize the pharmacological effects of YOH. We found that systemic administration of YOH increases both noradrenergic cell firing in the LC and catecholamines release in the AMY. Prior administration of the alpha-2 agonist clonidine prevents these effects on both the electrophysiological and the voltammetric signals  suggesting that YOH effects are mainly mediated by the alpha-2 adrenoceptors. In addition  we found that pre-treatment with the behaviourally active doses of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (CDE  Librium: BDZ very similar to diazepam) and of the non-BDZ buspirone counteract the effects of YOH on catecholamines release and cell firing. This suggests that the neurochemical and physiological effects of YOH measured in this study might be related to the anxiogenic effects of the drug. Thus  the presented electrophysiological-voltammetric-YOH study may be proposed as in vivo real time model of anxiety and this approach might be suitable for the evaluation of the neurochemical and physiological effects of new anxiolytic compounds."
"377","19405150","Mice lacking adenylyl cyclase-5 cope badly with repeated restraint stress.","Physiological responses to acute stress proceed with the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) system. Many brain regions are known to modulate the HPA axis activation in stress responses  but the detailed neural circuits and signaling system in the upstream of the HPA axis have to be explored further. Type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5) is highly concentrated in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens  which are implicated in reward and stress-related behavior. AC5(-/-) mice exposed to daily 2-hr restraint stress for only 3-5 days showed poor stress-coping responses  including severe body weight loss  poor coat condition  respiratory difficulties  and freezing behavior. Plasma corticosterone levels during 2-hr stress sessions increased in AC5(-/-) mice compared with those of AC5(+/+) mice. However  neither the corticosterone receptor antagonist RU486 nor the CRH receptor antagonist NBI27914 blocked their poor stress coping  whereas the administration of the GABA(A) receptor allosteric modulator diazepam or the D1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH23390 prior to restraint stress sessions changed their stress-coping response to the stressed AC5(+/+) mouse level. Stress-triggered c-Fos expression was completely blunted in the dorsal striatum of AC5(-/-). These results suggest that the AC5-associated signal system and neural network are involved in the regulation of anxiety and stress-coping response."

The animals were intoxicated with chlorfenvinphos (6 mg/kg  p.o.) and treated immediately  24 and 48 hrs later with obidoxime (50 mg/kg  i.p.)  atropine (10 mg/kg  i.p.)  and diazepam (10 mg/kg  i.p.) in a single dose  or in various combinations (with 2-3 drugs) simultaneously. Total tissue acetylcholinesterase activities were monitored at 2  72  and 168 hrs after intoxication. Enzyme activity was determined using Ellman's colorimetric method. The results of the present study show that obidoxime administered separately and jointly with atropine and diazepam 24 hrs after intoxication was effective on reactivation of chlorfenvinphos-inhibited acetylcholinesterase in the central nervous system and in the peripheral tissues. However  the application of obidoxime alone or in combination with atropine and diazepam 48 hrs after chlorfenvinphos intoxication caused an increased unfavourable effect in rats. The results obtained also indicate an unfavourable interaction of obidoxime with diazepam in the course of chlorfenvinphos poisoning  when antidotes were administered immediately  24 and 48 hrs after intoxication."

In this study  we investigated the neuroprotective effects of repeated drug administration after long-lasting status epilepticus. Groups of six to eight Wistar rats received microinjections of pilocarpine (2.4 mg/microl  1 microl) in the right dorsal hippocampus to induce a status epilepticus  which was attenuated by thiopental injection (35 mg/kg  i.p.) 3 hrs after onset. Treatments consisted of i.p. administration of diazepam  ketamine  carbamazepine  or phenytoin at 4  28  52  and 76 hr after the onset of status epilepticus. Two days after the treatments  rats were tested in the Morris water maze and 1 week after the cognitive tests  their brains were submitted to histology to perform haematoxylin and eosin staining and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunofluorescence detection. Post-status epilepticus rats exhibited extensive gliosis and cell loss in the hippocampal CA1  CA3 (70% cell loss for both areas) and dentate gyrus (60%). Administration of all drugs reduced cell loss in the hippocampus  with best effects observed in brains slices of diazepam-treated animals  which showed less than 30% of loss in the three areas and decreased GFAP immunolabelling. Treatments improved spatial navigation during training trials and probe trial  with exception of ketamine. Interestingly  in the probe trial  only diazepam-treated animals showed preference for the goal quadrant. Our data point to significant neuroprotective effects of repeated administration of diazepam against status epilepticus-induced cell damage and cognitive disturbances."

Observed behavioral changes were functionally coupled to CRF(1)-mediated elevated central cholecystokinin (CCK) tone in discrete brain regions. However  the changes in gene expression that mediated &quot;priming&quot;-induced behavioral and concurrent molecular changes in specific brain regions remained unknown. In the present study  a complementary DNA microarray analysis was used to investigate gene expression profiles in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of C57BL/6J mice following the &quot;priming&quot; procedure. Here  we report that chronic stimulation of CRF(1)  by i.c.v. administration of 10 ng Cortagine for five days  brought about alterations in the expression of a wide range of hippocampal (31 genes) and PFC (18 genes) genes  implicated in anxiety and aversive memory formation. These expression changes involved genes associated with signal transduction  neurotransmitter secretion  synaptic transmission  myelination  and others involved in the transport  biosynthesis  and binding of proteins. In particular  several genes of the protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling cascades  known to be involved in synaptic plasticity  such as neurogranin  calmodulin 3  and the PKA regulatory subunit 1 b were found to be upregulated in the PFC and hippocampus of CRF(1) agonist &quot;primed&quot; mice. Moreover  we show pharmacologically that one of the newly implicated memory regulatory elements  diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) is functionally involved in hippocampus-dependent enhancement of contextual fear  a cardinal phenotypic feature of the &quot;primed&quot; mice. Finally  an interaction network mapping of the altered genes and their known interacting partners identified additional molecular candidates responsible for CRF(1)-mediated hypersensitive fear circuitry."

Since the efficacy of an anxiolytic compound is a function of the animal's basal anxiety level  it is possible that chronic treatment with a benzodiazepine (Bzp) affects LA and HA animals differently. Based on these assumptions  this study aimed to provide some additional information on the influence of acute  chronic (18 days) and withdrawal effects (48 h) from diazepam (10 mg/kg)  in rats with LA or HA levels  on startle response amplitude. For this purpose  the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test was used. In addition  the role of glutamate receptors of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (cIC)  the most important mesencephalic tectum integrative structure of the auditory pathways and a brain region that is linked to the processing of auditory information of aversive nature  was also evaluated. Our results showed that  contrary to the results obtained in LA rats  long-term treatment with diazepam promoted anxiolytic and aversive effects in HA animals that were tested under chronic effects or withdrawal from this drug  respectively. In addition  since Bzp withdrawal may function as an unconditioned stressor  the negative affective states observed in HA rats could be a by-product of GABA-glutamate imbalance in brain systems that modulate unconditioned fear and anxiety behaviors  since the blockade of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors in the cIC clearly reduced the aversion promoted by diazepam withdrawal."
"382","19332330","Intranasal delivery of antiepileptic medications for treatment of seizures.","Acute isolated seizure  repetitive or recurrent seizures  and status epilepticus are all deemed medical emergencies. Mortality and worse neurologic outcome are directly associated with the duration of seizure activity. A number of recent reviews have described consensus statements regarding the pharmacologic treatment protocols for seizures when patients are in pre-hospital  institutional  and home-bound settings. Benzodiazepines  such as lorazepam  diazepam  midazolam  and clonazepam are considered to be medications of first choice. The rapidity by which a medication can be delivered to the systemic circulation and then to the brain plays a significant role in reducing the time needed to treat seizures and reduce opportunity for damage to the CNS. Speed of delivery  particularly outside of the hospital  is enhanced when transmucosal routes of delivery are used in place of an intravenous injection. Intranasal transmucosal delivery of benzodiazepines is useful in reducing time to drug administration and cessation of seizures in the pre-hospital setting  when actively seizing patients arrive in the emergency room  and at home where caregivers treat their dependents. This review summarizes factors to consider when choosing a benzodiazepine for intranasal administration  including formulation and device considerations  pharmacology and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles. A review of the most relevant clinical studies in epilepsy patients will provide context for the relative success of this technique with a number of benzodiazepines and relatively less sophisticated nasal preparations. Neuropeptides delivered intranasally  crossing the blood-brain barrier via the olfactory system  may increase the availability of medications for treatment of epilepsy. Consequently  there remains a significant unmet medical need to serve the pharamcotherapeutic requirements of epilepsy patients through commercial development and marketing of intranasal antiepileptic products."
"383","19303919","Seizure activity involved in the up-regulation of BDNF mRNA expression by activation of central mu opioid receptors.","Chemical-induced seizures up-regulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of endogenous opioids preferentially activating mu opioid receptor (MOR) could also increase BDNF mRNA expression. The aim of this study was to determine to what extent i.c.v. administration of synthetic MOR-selective agonists in rats can modulate both seizure activity and up-regulation of BDNF mRNA expression. Effects and potencies of i.c.v. administration of morphine and [D-Ala(2)  N-Me-Phe(4)  Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO)  were directly investigated by scoring behavioral seizures and measuring BDNF mRNA expression. In addition  effects of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone and antiepileptic drugs  diazepam  phenobarbital  and valproate  on i.c.v. MOR agonist-induced behavioral seizures and up-regulation of BDNF mRNA expression were determined. A single i.c.v. administration of morphine (10-100 microg) or DAMGO (0.15-1.5 microg) dose-dependently elicited behavioral seizures and increased BDNF mRNA expression in the widespread brain regions. However  s.c. administration of MOR agonists neither produced behavioral seizures nor increased BDNF mRNA expression. Pretreatment with naloxone 1 mg/kg significantly reduced behavioral seizure scores and the up-regulation of BDNF mRNA expression elicited by i.c.v. morphine or DAMGO. Similarly  diazepam 10 mg/kg and phenobarbital 40 mg/kg significantly blocked i.c.v. MOR agonist-induced actions. Pretreatment with valproate 300 mg/kg only attenuated behavioral seizures  but it did not affect morphine-induced increase of BDNF mRNA expression. This study provides supporting evidence that seizure activity plays an important role in the up-regulation of BDNF mRNA expression elicited by central MOR activation and that decreased inhibitory action of GABAergic system through the modulation on GABA receptor synaptic function by central MOR activation is involved in its regulation of BDNF mRNA expression."

Benzodiazepines have been widely used as hypnotics and anxiolytics  producing a decrease in cerebrocortical norepinephrine release. We hypothesized that there was some interaction between benzodiazepines and the UII system in the cerebral cortex.METHODS: In the present study  we have examined the effects of benzodiazepines on UII-increased norepinephrine release from rat cerebrocortical slices and intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)]i) in HEK293 cells expressing rat UT receptor (HEK293-rUT cells).RESULTS: Midazolam  diazepam and flunitrazepam concentration-dependently inhibited UII-evoked norepinephrine release but did not affect [Ca(2+)]i. The IC(50) of midazolam for inhibition of UII-evoked norepinephrine release (0.32 microM  P &lt; 0.01) was significantly lower than that of diazepam (187 microM) or flunitrazepam (40 microM). The inhibitory effects of midazolam on UII-evoked norepinephrine release were significantly attenuated by flumazenil  a benzodiazepine site antagonist.CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that midazolam  at clinically relevant concentration  significantly inhibited UII-evoked norepinephrine release. This inhibitory effect may be partially mediated via central benzodiazepine receptors."

In the present study  we adopted a dual approach to investigate shoaling behavior in the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes): a behavioral pharmacological approach to assess mirror approaching behavior and an immunohistochemical approach to examine the neurotransmitter distribution in the medaka telencephalon. In order to gain an insight into shoaling activity  we examined the pharmacological effects of the positive allosteric modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) anti-anxiety drug  diazepam  and chlorpromazine  a predominantly dopaminergic antagonist on mirror approaching behavior and  in particular  mirror approaching time (MAT; a tendency to shoal) and swimming distance (SWD). Diazepam dose-dependently suppressed MAT  but had no effect on SWD. Conversely  chlorpromazine suppressed SWD without having effects on MAT. The present study demonstrates for the first time that an anti-anxiety drug selectively modifies shoaling behavior in fish. Although the mechanism of this modification remains to be fully identified  immunohistochemical analysis suggests that a positive allosteric modulator of GABA acts on two distinct telencephalic regions. Mirror approaching behavior therefore revealed a close relationship with the action of the GABA-nergic system and not the dopaminergic system in the medaka telencephalon."

The temperature and heart rate were recorded by telemetry  and the plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels were used as indices of the HPA activation. The dopamine release from striatal and amygdala slices after peptide treatment (100 nM and 1 microM) was measured with a superfusion apparatus. To establish the transmission of the HPA response  animals were pretreated with the corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor antagonist antalarmin or astressin 2B (0.5 nmol). In the OF test  the animals were pretreated with antalarmin or haloperidol (10 microg/kg)  while in the EPM test they were pretreated with antalarmin or diazepam (1 mg/kg). NPAF stimulated ACTH and corticosterone release  which was inhibited by antalarmin. It activated exploratory locomotion (square crossings and rearings) and grooming in OF observations  and decreased the entries to and the time spent in the open arms during the EPM tests. The antagonists inhibited the locomotor responses  and also attenuated grooming and the EPM responses. NPAF also increased spontaneous locomotion  and tended to decrease the core temperature and the heart rate in telemetry  while it augmented the dopamine release from striatal and amygdala slices. These results demonstrate  that acute administration of exogenous NPAF stimulates the HPA axis and behavioral paradigms through CRH and dopamine release."

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increase proliferation of neuronal progenitors in rodent hippocampus after a delay of approximately 2 weeks.METHODS: We have used this delayed increase in neurogenesis  as detected with both a rapid dot-blot method and with immunostaining  as a model of the delayed clinical antidepressant effects.RESULTS: Whereas the SSRI fluoxetine alone significantly increased both neurogenesis and survival of newborn cells when administered for 2-3 weeks  co-treatment with diazepam and fluoxetine completely blocked the increase in both neurogenesis and survival. Furthermore  neurogenesis was not increased when fluoxetine and diazepam were first co-administered for 2 weeks and then fluoxetine was given alone for 2 additional weeks. Moreover  we show that daily administration is necessary for neurogenesis  because injection of fluoxetine for up to 1 week failed to increase neurogenesis  when assayed at 14 days from the first injection.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that benzodiazepines might interfere with the clinical effects of fluoxetine or that increased neurogenesis is not a valid model for the delayed onset of the clinical antidepressant effects."

Memantine treatment substantially attenuated motor impairment induced by an acute challenge with diazepam (6 mg/kg  i.p.)  as assessed by the rotarod test and the horizontal wire test.

Our findings were: (i) one single MK801 application increased precursor cell proliferation and adult neurogenesis but not gliogenesis 4 weeks later; (ii) the number of label-retaining precursor cells decreased after MK801 (with P = 0.06); (iii) the pro-neurogenic effect included increased cell cycle entry of precursor cells as well as completed cell divisions  except in type-2a cells; (iv) NMDA receptor blockade also increased the number of nestin-GFP-expressing cells expressing calretinin; (v) diazepam alone had a very similar effect on overall precursor cell proliferation to that of MK801 alone; and (vi) diazepam  when co-applied with MK801  abolished the suppression of divisions of type-2a cells induced by MK801 alone  suppressed the MK801-induced effect on proliferation of type-2b cells and had no influence on the effects of MK801 on type-3 cells  but did suppress the increased number of nestin-GFP-positive cells expressing calretinin. From these results we hypothesize that  depending on the precursor cell stage  NMDA-dependent neurotransmission has distinct effects that are partly antagonized and partly enhanced by GABAergic input. We propose that NMDA receptor-dependent signalling maintains the precursor cells in the dentate gyrus while blocking initial stages of development and promoting more advanced stages."

Brain penetration of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may be affected by BBB damage. We studied the effects of BBB damage on brain distribution of hydrophilic [deoxy-glucose (DOG) and sucrose] and lipophilic (phenytoin and diazepam) molecules. We tested the hypothesis that lipophilic and hydrophilic drug distribution is differentially affected by BBB damage.METHODS: In vivo BBB disruption (BBBD) was performed in rats by intracarotid injection of hyperosmotic mannitol. Drugs (H3-sucrose  3H-deoxy-glucose  14C-phenytoin  and C14-diazepam) or unlabeled phenytoin was measured and correlated to brain water content and protein extravasation. In vitro hippocampal slices were exposed to different osmolarities; drug penetration and water content were assessed by analytic and densitometric methods  respectively.RESULTS: BBBD resulted in extravasation of serum protein and radiolabeled drugs  but was associated with no significant change in brain water. Large shifts in water content in brain slices in vitro caused a small effect on drug penetration. In both cases  total drug permeability increase was greater for lipophilic than hydrophilic compounds. BBBD reduced the amount of free phenytoin in the brain.DISCUSSION: After BBBD  drug binding to protein is the main controller of total brain drug accumulation. Osmotic BBBD increased serum protein extravasation and reduced free phenytoin brain levels. These results underlie the importance of brain environment and BBB integrity in determining drug distribution to the brain. If confirmed in drug-resistant models  these mechanisms could contribute to drug brain distribution in refractory epilepsies."

We activated extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors in cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons and measured single-channel currents in order to compare the actions of two drugs that potentially target different GABA(A) receptor subtypes. Despite the possible difference in receptor targets of etomidate and diazepam  the two drugs were similar in their actions on native extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. Each drug produced three distinct responses that differed significantly in current magnitude  implying heterogeneous GABA(A) receptor populations. In the majority of patches  drug application increased both the single-channel conductance (&gt;40 pS) and the open probability of the channels. By contrast  in the minority of patches  drug application caused an increase in open probability only. In the third group high-conductance channels were observed upon GABA activation and drug application increased their open probability only. The currents potentiated by etomidate or diazepam were substantially larger in patches displaying high-conductance GABA channels compared to those displaying only low-conductance channels. Factors contributing to the large magnitude of these currents were the long mean open time of high-conductance channels and the presence of multiple channels in these patches. In conclusion  we suggest that the local density of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors may influence their single-channel properties and may be an additional regulating factor for tonic inhibition and  importantly  differential drug modulation."

The extent of P450scc induction increased with increasing SE duration. Paradoxically  increased P450scc induction in rats experiencing SE for 180 min or more was associated with the delayed onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Treatment with the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride (100 mg/kg/day for 25 days)  which inhibits the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor modulating neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone  was associated with a significant reduction in time to the onset of spontaneous seizures in rats exposed to 180-min but not 90-min SE.DISCUSSION: P450scc is induced by SE in a diverse population of hippocampal glia. Induction of P450scc is associated with the delayed onset of spontaneous seizures. Conversely  inhibition of neurosteroid synthesis accelerated the onset of spontaneous seizures  but only in animals exhibiting significant increases in P450scc. These findings suggest that induction of neurosteroid synthesis in reactive glial cells is associated with delayed onset of spontaneously recurrent seizures."
"395","19127342","Diazepam administration after prolonged status epilepticus reduces neurodegeneration in the amygdala but not in the hippocampus during epileptogenesis.","An episode of status epilepticus (SE)  if left untreated  can lead to death  or brain damage with long-term neurological consequences  including the development of epilepsy. The most common first-line treatment of SE is administration of benzodiazepines (BZs). However  the efficacy of BZs in terminating seizures is reduced with time after the onset of SE; this is accompanied by a reduced efficacy in protecting the hippocampus against neuronal damage  and is associated with impaired function and internalization of hippocampal GABA(A) receptors. In the present study  using Fluoro-Jade C staining  we found that administration of diazepam to rats at 3 h after the onset of kainic acid-induced SE  at a dose sufficient to terminate SE  had no protective effect on the hippocampus  but produced a significant reduction in neuronal degeneration in the amygdala  piriform cortex  and endopiriform nucleus  examined on days 7-9 after SE. Thus  in contrast to the hippocampus  the amygdala and other limbic structures are responsive to neuroprotection by BZs after prolonged SE  suggesting that GABA(A) receptors are not significantly altered in these structures during SE."

The GABA-A receptor  which is a major target for the inhibitory control  is composed of five subunits. The presence of an alpha(1)-  alpha(2)-  alpha(3)-  or alpha(5)-subunit in the GABA-A receptor protein complex is necessary for benzodiazepines to exert their potentiating effect on the receptor. We postulate that the effect of nonselective benzodiazepines on the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis is critically dependent on the composition of the GABA-A receptor subunits through which they act. We show here that positive modulators of alpha(1)-subtype containing GABA-A receptors with zolpidem (10 mg/kg) increase HPA activity in terms of increase in plasma corticosterone and induction of Fos in the PVN  whereas activation of non-alpha(1)-subtype GABA-A receptors using L-818 417 (10 mg/kg) likely inhibits the activity. We also show that the alpha(2)-subunit gene is highly expressed in the PVN  but its expression is not affected by chronic mild stress. These results show that the stimulatory effect on HPA activity after positive modulation of GABA-A receptors composed of alpha(1)-subunit(s) affects a selective afferent system than the PVN  which is distinct from another afferent system(s) activated by non alpha(1)-containing GABA-A receptors."

However  the underlying neuronal mechanisms are unclear. The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of GABA(A) receptors within the framework of nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) in haloperidol-induced hyperphagia and body weight gain in sated rats.MAIN METHODS: In acute studies  GABA(A) receptor agonists muscimol  diazepam or antagonist bicuculline were administered by AcbSh route  alone or in combination with haloperidol (intraperitoneal/ip). Immediately after these treatments  preweighed food was offered to the animals at commencement of dark phase. Cumulative food intake was measured at 2 and 6 h post-injection time-points. Furthermore  effects of subacute haloperidol treatment  alone or in combination with muscimol  diazepam or bicuculline  on food intake and body weight were investigated.KEY FINDINGS: While acute treatment with haloperidol  muscimol or diazepam dose dependently stimulated the food intake  bicuculline suppressed the same. Prior administration of muscimol (20 ng/rat  intra-AcbSh) and diazepam (5 microg/rat  intra-AcbSh) significantly potentiated  whereas bicuculline (40 ng/rat  intra-AcbSh) negated the hyperphagic effect of acute haloperidol (0.005 or 0.01 mg/kg/rat  ip). Subacute administration of haloperidol (0.01 mg/kg/rat/day  ip) for 15 days produced increase in food intake and body weight. Although  concomitant administration of muscimol (20 ng/rat/day  intra-AcbSh) or diazepam (5 microg/rat/day  intra-AcbSh) markedly enhanced  bicuculline (40 ng/rat/day  intra-AcbSh) prevented the subacute haloperidol-induced hyperphagia and weight gain.SIGNIFICANCE: The results of present study suggest that increased food intake and body weight following haloperidol treatment in rats  may be mediated via AcbSh GABA(A) receptors."

In plasma and brain tissue there are i.e. diazepam and nordiazepam equal to commercial drugs but there are also other benzodiazepine-like compounds termed &quot;endozepines&quot;  which act as agonists at the benzodiazepine receptors of central type (CBR). A synthetic pathway for the production of NBZDs has not yet been found  but it has been suggested that micro-organisms may synthesize molecules with benzodiazepine-like structures. Hence NBZDs could be of both endogenous and exogenous source and be considered as natural anxyolitic and sedative. Interestingly there are also natural compounds  such as the polypeptide Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI) acting as an &quot;inversive agonist&quot; implicated in fair and panic disorders. It has been suggested that NBZDs may play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Multidirectional studies evaluated NBZDs levels (1) in the blood of normal subjects  of cirrhotic with or without HE and in commercial benzodiazepine consumers; (2) in the blood of cirrhotic treated or not with a non-absorbable antibiotic; (3) in several constituents of our diet. In conclusion  NBZDs increase sometime in cirrhotics with or without HE but they reach concentrations not higher than those found in commercial benzodiazepines consumers. Hence NBZDs must be considered as occasional precipitating factor of HE and benzodiazepine antagonists only symptomatic drugs. The finding that NBZDs may be in part synthesized by intestinal bacterial flora and in part constituent of our diet underlines the importance to feed cirrhotic patients with selected food."

In view of the withdrawal anxiety associated with repeated diazepam intake  the present study concerns the efficacy of 5-HT2C receptors in rats treated with diazepam. Results show that diazepam injections at a dose of 2 mg/kg daily for two weeks increased weekly food intake and growth rate. Anxiolytic effects of the drug monitored in a light/dark activity box were not significant after single administration. One week and two weeks of administration elicited anxiolytic effects  which were smaller after two weeks of administration as compared to one week  suggesting the development of tolerance to the anxiolytic profile of diazepam. Moreover  three days' withdrawal from repeated administration elicited anxiogenic behavior in the light/dark activity box. The behavioral and neurochemical effects of 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine (m-CPP) (3 mg/kg)  a 5-HT2C agonist  were monitored following withdrawal (three days) from two weeks of diazepam administration. Results showed that hypophagic as well as anxiogenic-like effects of m-CPP were not different from repeated saline or repeated diazepam-injected animals. Administration of m-CPP increased 5-HT metabolism in repeated saline as well as repeated diazepam-injected animals. However  m-CPP-induced increases in 5-HT metabolism were greater in repeated diazepam-injected animals. Results are discussed in the context of the role of 5-HT2C receptors in the precipitation of withdrawal anxiety."

We have systematically mapped the nature and extent of MK-801-induced neurodegeneration throughout the neonatal murine brain in order to genetically dissect the mechanism of these effects. Highest levels of MK-801-induced neurodegeneration are seen in the cerebellar external germinal layer; while mature neurons of the internal granule layer are unaffected by MK-801 treatment. Examination of external germinal layer neurons by electron microscopy  terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling  and caspase-3 activation demonstrate that these neurons die through the process of programmed cell death soon after they exit from the cell cycle. Significantly  ablation of caspase-3 activity completely inhibited the MK-801-induced (and developmental) programmed cell death of external germinal layer neurons. Similar to caspase-3  inactivation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in vivo using scopolamine inhibited MK-801-induced programmed cell death. By contrast  the GABAergic agonist diazepam  either alone or in combination with MK-801  enhanced programmed cell death within external germinal layer neurons. These data demonstrate that  in vivo  cerebellar granule neurons undergo a dramatic change in intracellular signaling in response to molecules present in the local cellular milieu during their first 24 h following exit from the cell cycle."

Reproduction rates of homozygous Wfs1-deficient mice were slightly below the expected values  they displayed intolerance to glucose and overall lower body weight. The present behavioural study was performed in female Wfs1-deficient mice due to their milder metabolic disturbances. Non-fasting blood glucose levels did not differ between homozygous Wfs1-deficient mice and wild-type littermates. While there was no difference in baseline plasma corticosterone  exposure to stress induced a nearly three-fold elevation of corticosterone in Wfs1-deficient mice in relation to wild-type littermates. Wfs1-deficient mice did not display obvious shortcomings in sensory and motor functioning as exemplified by intact responses in conditioned learning paradigms and rota-rod test. Locomotor activity of Wfs1-deficient mice was significantly lower only in brightly lit environment. Short-term isolation had a significant anxiogenic-like effect on the behaviour of Wfs1-deficient mice in dark/light exploration test. Lower exploratory activity of Wfs1-deficient mice in the plus-maze was antagonised by pre-treatment with diazepam (1 mg/kg)  a GABA(A) receptor agonist. Wfs1-deficient mice displayed increased anxiety-like behaviour in hyponeophagia test. The locomotor stimulatory effects of amphetamine (2.5-7.5 mg/kg) and apomorphine (3 mg/kg) were significantly attenuated and facilitated  respectively  in Wfs1-deficient mice. There were no differences between Wfs1-deficient mice and wild-types in forced swimming behaviour and conditioned fear responses. Subtle impairments in reversal learning were apparent in Wfs1-deficient mice in the Morris water maze. Altogether  the present study demonstrates impaired behavioural adaptation of Wfs1-deficient mice in stress-inducing situations. It is likely that Wfs1 protein plays a major role in the behavioural adaptation mechanisms to novel and stressful environments."

To this aim  the effects of NPS (0.01  0.1 and 1 nmol  ICV)  AMPH (2 mg/kg  IP) and DZP (1 mg/kg  IP) on locomotion and oxidative stress parameters were assessed in mouse brain structures. The administration of NPS and AMPH  but not DZP  increased locomotion compared to control. Biochemical analyses revealed that AMPH increased carbonylated proteins in striatum  but did not alter lipid peroxidation. DZP increased lipid peroxidation in the cortex and cerebellum  and increased protein carbonyl formation in the striatum. In contrast  NPS reduced carbonylated protein in the cerebellum and striatum  and also lipid peroxidation in the cortex. Additionally  the treatment with AMPH increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the striatum  while it did not affect catalase (CAT) activity. DZP did not alter SOD and CAT activity. NPS inhibited the increase of SOD activity in the cortex and cerebellum  but little influenced CAT activity. Altogether  this is the first evidence of a putative role of NPS in oxidative stress and brain injury."

Here we explored whether such agents influence early postnatal neurogenesis.METHODS: The N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist MK801 and the GABA subtype A agonists phenobarbital and diazepam were administered to infant rats  and cell proliferation and neurogenesis were studied in the brain using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine and doublecortin immunohistochemistry and stereology. Using confocal microscopy  we quantified neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus on postnatal day 15 (P15) after treatment with MK801 or phenobarbital on P6 to P10. Learning and memory were assessed at the age of 6 months after early postnatal treatment with phenobarbital.RESULTS: MK801  phenobarbital  and diazepam reduced numbers of newly born cells in the brain. We found no evidence that these agents caused apoptosis of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-positive cells. In the dentate gyrus  many of the newly formed cells differentiated toward a neuronal phenotype. Phenobarbital and MK801 reduced numbers of newly formed neurons in the dentate gyrus. At the age of 6 months  phenobarbital-treated rats had fewer neurons in the dentate gyrus and performed worse than saline-treated littermates in water maze learning and memory task.INTERPRETATION: These findings show that blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated excitation and enhancement of GABA subtype A receptor activation impair cell proliferation and inhibit neurogenesis in the immature rat brain. Because many sedative and antiepileptic drugs used in pediatric medicine act via these mechanisms  our findings raise concerns about their potential impact on human brain development."

To further explore the mechanisms responsible for these phenomena  we studied the effects of prolonged diazepam treatment on the recombinant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptors  stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. The results demonstrating that long-term (48 and 72 h) exposure of cells to a high concentration of diazepam (50 microM) enhanced the maximum number (B(max)) of [(3)H]flunitrazepam  [(3)H]muscimol and [(3)H]t-butylbicycloorthobenzoate ([(3)H]TBOB) binding sites  without changing their affinity (K(d))  suggested the up-regulation of GABA(A) receptors. As demonstrated by cell counting and WST-1 proliferation assay  the observed increase in receptor expression was not a consequence of stimulated growth of cells exposed to diazepam. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis  showing elevated levels of alpha(1) subunit mRNA as well as beta(2) and gamma(2) subunit proteins  respectively  suggested that prolonged high dose diazepam treatment induced de novo receptor synthesis by acting at both transcriptional and translational levels. The finding that the number of GABA(A) receptor binding sites returned to control value 24 h following diazepam withdrawal  makes this process less likely to account for the development of benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence. On the other hand  the results demonstrating that observed functional uncoupling between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites persisted after the termination of diazepam treatment supported the hypothesis of its possible role in these phenomena."

Long-term potentiation (LTP) was performed in mouse hippocampal slices. Cognitive effects were assessed in rats in the delayed match to position (DMTP) task and the Morris water maze. In monkeys  the object retrieval task was used. Pro-convulsant and anxiogenic potentials were evaluated in mice and rats. In vivo receptor occupancy was determined using [3H]-RO0154513.RESULTS: RO4938581 is a potent inverse agonist at the GABAA alpha5 receptor  with both binding and functional selectivity  enhancing hippocampal LTP. RO4938581 reversed scopolamine-induced working memory impairment in the DMTP task (0.3-1 mg/kg p.o.) and diazepam-induced spatial learning impairment (1-10 mg/kg p.o.). RO4938581 improved executive function in monkeys (3-10 mg/kg p.o.). Importantly  RO4938581 showed no anxiogenic and pro-convulsive potential. RO4938581 dose-dependently bound to GABAA alpha5 receptors and approximately 30% receptor occupancy was sufficient to produce enhanced cognition in the rat.CONCLUSIONS: The data further support the potential of GABAA alpha5 receptors as a target for cognition-enhancing drugs. The dual binding and functional selectivity offers an ideal profile for cognition-enhancing effects without the unwanted side effects associated with activity at other GABAA receptor subtypes."

The MKL diets produced a significant dose-dependent improvement in the memory scores of young and aged mice and significantly reduced the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg  i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg  i.p.). Also  brain cholinesterase activity and total cholesterol levels were reduced by the MKL diets.

We used histological  immunohistochemical and electrophysiological endpoints to address this question. Gerbils underwent 5 min of global ischemia followed by 10 mg/kg diazepam (D) given 30 and 90 min later. Other animals were subjected to sham surgery  normothermic ischemia (I) or ischemia at 32 degrees C (Hypo). Postischemic brain temperature was regulated at approximately 37 degrees C for 24 h. Gerbils in the D and I groups were sacrificed 1  2 and 3 days after ischemia. Sham and Hypo gerbils were sacrificed on day 3. CA1 cell counts  MAP2 staining and CA1 field potentials were performed at each survival time. Hypothermia prevented CA1 necrosis  preserved MAP2 integrity and maintained CA1 field potential amplitude. Ischemic gerbils showed a significant reduction in these 3 outcome measures by day 3. Diazepam-treated gerbils exhibited near normal levels of CA1 neurons and MAP2 staining. Most importantly  CA1 field potentials were similar to sham values and significantly preserved relative to non-treated ischemic gerbils. Diazepam maintains near normal structural and functional integrity up to 3 days after a global ischemic insult. As such  this drug may be useful for extending the therapeutic time window after cardiac arrest  stroke and related disorders."

Growing evidence suggests a role for voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) regulation in mediating a range of chronic drug effects from drug withdrawal phenomena to dependence on a variety of drugs of abuse. High voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents were measured in whole-cell recordings from acutely isolated hippocampal CA1 neurons after a 1-week flurazepam (FZP) treatment that results in withdrawal-anxiety. An approximately 1.8-fold increase in Ca(2+) current density was detected immediately after and up to 2 days but not 3 or 4 days after drug withdrawal. Current density was unchanged after acute desalkyl-FZP treatment. A significant negative shift of the half-maximal potential of activation of HVA currents was also observed but steady-state inactivation remained unchanged. FZP and diazepam showed use- and concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca(2+) currents in hippocampal cultured cells following depolarizing trains (FZP  IC(50) = 1.8 microM; diazepam  IC(50) = 36 microM)  pointing to an additional mechanism by which benzodiazepines modulate HVA Ca(2+) channels. Systemic preinjection of nimodipine (10 mg/kg)  an L-type (L)-VGCC antagonist  prevented the benzodiazepine-induced increase in alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxasole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current in CA1 neurons 2 days after FZP withdrawal  suggesting that AMPAR potentiation  previously linked to withdrawal-anxiety may require enhanced L-VGCC-mediated Ca(2+) influx. Taken together with prior work  these findings suggest that enhanced Ca(2+) entry through HVA Ca(2+) channels may contribute to hippocampal AMPAR plasticity and serve as a potential mechanism underlying benzodiazepine physical dependence."

In about one third of patients  SE is unresponsive to sequential treatment with first- and second-line antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). At least in part  this drug resistance may be due to AED target alterations induced by SE  such as reduced membrane expression of GABA(A) receptors. Apart from target alterations by receptor trafficking  SE is known to increase the brain expression of drug efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp)  which might reduce concentrations of AEDs at their brain targets. However  it is not known whether overexpression of Pgp develops rapidly enough after onset of SE to be of any functional consequence for drug treatment. Therefore  we studied whether overexpression of Pgp at the blood-brain barrier is involved in refractory SE. Two rat SE models were used  the lithium/pilocarpine model and induction of SE by sustained electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Four AEDs  diazepam (DZP)  phenobarbital (PB) and phenytoin (PHT) or fosphenytoin (FPHT) were administered at different times after onset of SE. In the pilocarpine model  once self-sustained SE was established  none of the AEDs alone was effective in terminating SE  but sequential injection of PB and DZP stopped SE. Administration of the Pgp inhibitor tariquidar did not prevent or counteract resistance to AEDs. In the BLA model  DZP and PB terminated SE in the majority of rats  whereas PHT or FPHT were ineffective. Immunohistochemical staining of Pgp did not indicate any increase of Pgp expression in brain capillary endothelial cells during SE  whereas significant overexpression was determined in both models 48 h after SE. The data suggest that  at least under the conditions of the present study  alterations in Pgp are not critically involved in refractory SE."

After i.n. administration  DZ was rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation  and readily and homogeneously distributed into the different regions of brain tissues with a t(max) of 5 and 10 min in rats and rabbits  respectively. The bioavailability of DZ in rat plasma (68.4%) and brain (67.7%) were 32-47% higher than those observed in rabbit plasma (51.6%) and brain (45.9%). The AUC(brain)/AUC(plasma) ratios in rabbits after i.n. administration (3.77+/-0.17) were slightly lower than from i.v. administration (4.23+/-0.08).

We have built a conditional knockout mouse model using the Cre/loxP approach. When crossed with transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the tubulin Talpha-1 promoter  we obtained animals with no AM expression in the CNS but normal levels in other organs. These animals lead normal lives and do not present any gross morphological defect. Specific areas of the brain of animals lacking CNS AM contain hyperpolymerized tubulin  a consequence of AM downregulation. Behavioral analysis shows that mice with no AM in their brain have impaired motor coordination and are hyperactive and overanxious when compared to their wild-type littermates. Treatment with methylphenidate  haloperidol  and diazepam did not show differences between genotypes. Circulating levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone were similar in knockout and wild-type mice. Animals with no brain AM were less resistant to hypobaric hypoxia than wild-type mice  demonstrating the neuroprotective function of AM in the CNS. In conclusion  AM exerts a beneficial action in the brain by maintaining homeostasis both under normal and stress conditions."

To interact with this receptor in the brain  substances such as valerenic acid and its derivatives acetoxyvalerenic acid and hydroxyvalerenic acid have to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The aim of our study was to obtain BBB permeability data of these compounds for the first time and to elucidate possible transport pathways across our BBB in vitro model. Transport of valerenic acid  acetoxyvalerenic acid and hydroxyvalerenic acid was compared with the permeability of the GABA (A) modulator diazepam  which is known to penetrate into the central nervous system transcellularly by passive diffusion. Experiments were carried out with an established Transwell in vitro model based on the human cell line ECV304. Results indicated clearly that all three acids permeated significantly slower than diazepam. The ranking was confirmed in group studies as well as in single-substance studies after normalization to diazepam. Valerenic acid (1.06 +/- 0.29 microm/min  factor 0.03 related to diazepam) was the slowest to permeate in the group study  followed by hydroxyvalerenic acid (2.72 +/- 0.63 microm/min  factor 0.07 related to diazepam) and acetoxyvalerenic acid (3.54 +/- 0.58 microm/min  factor 0.09 related to diazepam). To elucidate the contribution of the paracellular transport  studies were performed at different tightness status of the cell layers reflected by different transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values. Results showed an exponential correlation between transport and TEER for all three acids  whereas diazepam permeated TEER independently. In summary  it is hypothesized that the investigated compounds from Valeriana officinalis L. S.

Experiment 2 utilized in vivo microdialysis to assess NAcc DA levels before and after experimenter-administered i.v. cocaine injections (0.75 mg/kg/injection x 2; 10-min interval) in diazepam- and saline-pretreated rats. Group differences were not revealed across basal and cocaine-stimulated NAcc DA assessments  indicating that diazepam did not decrease NAcc DA during cocaine self-administration. Findings that diazepam enhances cocaine self-administration and decreases cocaine response latency support the notion that cocaine-induced anxiety limits voluntary cocaine intake. It is further suggested that individual variations in cocaine-induced aversive effects may determine whether cocaine use is avoided or repeated."

To characterize the effects of hypoxia on neuronal GABA(A)Rs  we subjected rat cortical neurons to 1% O2 for 2  4 or 8h  followed by recovery times of 0-96h  and used whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp recording to assess GABA(A)R currents and pharmacology. Hypoxic exposure for 4h caused downregulation of maximal GABA current immediately following hypoxia and after 48h recovery without changing the EC50 for GABA. Two- and eight-hour hypoxic exposures had inconsistent effects on GABA(A)R currents. Maximal diazepam potentiation was increased immediately following 4h hypoxia  while potentiation by zolpidem was increased after 48h recovery. Pentobarbital enhancement and zinc inhibition of GABA currents were unchanged. Hypoxia also caused a depolarizing shift in the reversal potential of GABA-induced Cl(-) currents after 24h recovery. The L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (L-VGCC) blocker  nitrendipine  during hypoxia or control treatment prevented the reduction in GABA(A)R currents  and increased control currents over baseline. Nitrendipine also prevented the increase in zolpidem potentiation 48h after hypoxia  and blocked the depolarizing shift in Cl(-) reversal potential 24h after hypoxia. The effects of hypoxia on maximal GABA(A)R currents  zolpidem pharmacology and Cl(-) reversal potential thus require depolarization-induced calcium entry via L-VGCCs  and constitutive L-VGCC activity appears to reduce maximal GABA(A)R currents in control neurons via a calcium-dependent process. Calcium-dependent modulation of GABA(A)R currents via L-VGCCs may be a fundamental regulatory mechanism for GABA receptor function."
"415","18660435","K+ channel TASK-1 knockout mice show enhanced sensitivities to ataxic and hypnotic effects of GABA(A) receptor ligands.","TASK two-pore-domain leak K(+) channels occur throughout the brain. However  TASK-1 and TASK-3 knockout (KO) mice have few neurological impairments and only mildly reduced sensitivities to inhalational anesthetics  contrasting with the anticipated functions and importance of these channels. TASK-1/-3 channel expression can compensate for the absence of GABA(A) receptors in GABA(A) alpha6 KO mice. To investigate the converse  we analyzed the behavior of TASK-1 and -3 KO mice after administering drugs with preferential efficacies at GABA(A) receptor subtypes: benzodiazepines (diazepam and flurazepam  active at alpha1betagamma2  alpha2betagamma2  alpha3betagamma2  and alpha5betagamma2 subtypes)  zolpidem (alpha1betagamma2 subtype)  propofol (beta2-3-containing receptors)  gaboxadol (alpha4betadelta and alpha6betadelta subtypes)  pregnanolone  and pentobarbital (many subtypes). TASK-1 KO mice showed increased motor impairment in rotarod and beam-walking tests after diazepam and flurazepam administration but not after zolpidem. They also showed prolonged loss of righting reflex induced by propofol and pentobarbital. Autoradiography indicated no change in GABA(A) receptor ligand binding levels. These altered behavioral responses to GABAergic drugs suggest functional up-regulation of alpha2beta2/3gamma2 and alpha3beta2/3gamma2 receptor subtypes in TASK-1 KO mice. In addition  female  but not male  TASK-1 KO mice were more sensitive to gaboxadol  suggesting an increased influence of alpha4betadelta or alpha6betadelta subtypes. The benzodiazepine sensitivity of TASK-3 KO mice was marginally increased. Our results underline that TASK-1 channels perform such key functions in the brain that compensation is needed for their absence. Furthermore  because inhalation anesthetics act partially through GABA(A) receptors  the up-regulation of GABA(A) receptor function in TASK-1 KO mice might mask TASK-1 channel's significance as a target for inhalation anesthetics."

Little is known about effects of alpha subunits on the structure of the binding pocket. We studied here the interaction of the covalently reacting diazepam analog 7-Isothiocyanato-5-phenyl-1 3-dihydro-2H-1 4-benzodiazepin-2-one (NCS compound) with alpha(1)H101Cbeta(2)gamma(2) and with receptors containing the homologous mutation  alpha(2)H101Cbeta(2)gamma(2)  alpha(3)H126Cbeta(2)gamma(2) and alpha(5)H105Cbeta(2)gamma(2). This comparison was extended to alpha(6)R100Cbeta(2)gamma(2) receptors as this mutation conveys to these receptors high affinity towards classical benzodiazepines. The interaction was studied at the ligand binding level and at the functional level using electrophysiological techniques. Results indicate that the geometry of alpha(6)R100Cbeta(2)gamma(2) enables best interaction with NCS compound  followed by alpha(3)H126Cbeta(2)gamma(2)  alpha(1)H101Cbeta(2)gamma(2) and alpha(2)H101Cbeta(2)gamma(2)  while alpha(5)H105Cbeta(2)gamma(2) receptors show little interaction. Our results allow conclusions about the relative apposition of alpha(1)H101 and homologous positions in alpha(2)  alpha(3)  alpha(5) and alpha(6) with the position occupied by -Cl in diazepam. During this study we found evidence for the presence of a novel site for benzodiazepines that prevents modulation of GABA(A) receptors via the classical benzodiazepine site. The novel site potentially contributes to the high degree of safety to some of these drugs. Our results indicate that this site may be located at the alpha/beta subunit interface pseudo-symmetrically to the site for classical benzodiazepines located at the alpha/gamma interface."

Therefore  we investigated the influence of GnRH agonists and antagonist on the anxiety-like behavior of rats in the elevated plus-maze and social interaction tests. GnRH agonists  leuprolide [100 or 200 ng/rat  intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.)] or 6-D-tryptophan luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (400 ng/rat  i.c.v.)  significantly increased percentage of open arms entries  time spent in open arms  and time spent in social interaction. The observed anxiolytic effect of these agents was comparable with diazepam (0.5-1.0 mg/kg  intraperitoneally). Treatment with a GnRH antagonist [pGlu-D-Phe-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Ala-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2  (100 ng/rat  i.c.v.)]  significantly reduced percentage of open arm indices and decreased time spent in social interaction  indicating an anxiogenic-like effect. Further  castrated rats exhibited anxiogenic-like behavior in these tests  which was significantly attenuated by leuprolide (200 ng/rat  i.c.v.) or 6-D-tryptophan luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (400 ng/rat  i.c.v.)  indicating the noninvolvement of peripheral sex hormone in their anxiolytic-like effect  at least in castrated rats. In conclusion  this study indicated a putative role of GnRH in the control of anxiety  and further adds to the importance of investigating the possible role of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis in regulating the anxiety-related disorders arising out of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation."

There are some models for this disease  most of them being conceptual. So  it seems that considering all physiological information and structural specifications to develop a holistic model is needed. We introduce a computational model based on experimental and physiological findings. Parts of the brain known to be involved in Huntington's disease are all considered in our model and most features of the movement disorders have been appeared in the model. This mathematical model has considered the involved parts of the brain in a fairly accurate way  explaining the behavior and mechanism of the disease according to the physiological information. Our model has several advantages. It is able to simulate the normal and Huntington's disease stride time intervals. It shows how the present treatment  i.e. diazepam  is able to ameliorate the gait disorder. In this research we assessed the effects of changing some neurotransmitter levels in order to propose new treatments. Although we showed that gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) blockers reduce Huntington's disease movement disorder  but we discussed that it is unfair to use this route for treatment. We evaluated our model response to increment of GABA  alone and observed that the gait disorder was strengthened. Our novel idea in this regard is resuscitation of BG loop in order to maintain its major physiological functions  and at the same time raising the threshold in order to weaken the internal disturbances. Our last idea about BG treatment is to decrease glutamate. Our model was able to show the effectiveness of this treatment on Huntington's disease disturbances. We propose that experimental studies should be designed in which these two novel methods of treatment will be evaluated. This validation would implement a milestone in treatment of such a debilitating disease at Huntington."

The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of oroxylin A on the memory impairments and pathological changes induced by Abeta(25-35) peptide in mice. The ameliorating effect of oroxylin A on memory impairment was investigated using passive avoidance and Y-maze tasks and pathological changes were identified by immunostaining and western blotting. Abeta(25-35) peptide (5nmol) was administered by intracerebroventricular injection. In the acute treatment study  a single dose of oroxylin A (5mg/kg  p.o.) treated 1h before behavioral tests was found to significantly reverse Abeta(25-35)-induced cognitive impairments based on passive avoidance and Y-maze task findings (P&lt;0.05). Moreover  these acute effects of oroxylin A were blocked by diazepam (1mg/kg  i.p.)  a GABA(A)/benzodiazepine binding site agonist (P&lt;0.05). On the other hand  our subchronic studies revealed that oroxylin A (1 or 5mg/kg/day  p.o.) for 7 days ameliorated the memory impairment induced by Abeta(25-35) peptide. Moreover  Abeta(25-35)-induced increases in GFAP (an astroglia marker) and OX-42 (a microglia marker)  and increases in iNOS positive cells in the hippocampus were found to be attenuated by subchronic oroxylin A (1 or 5mg/kg/day  i.p.

In addition  reductions in the immunoreactivity and protein level of ChAT (a cholinergic neuronal cell marker) in the CA3 hippocampal area induced by Abeta(25-35) peptide were also attenuated by oroxylin A. Furthermore  lipid peroxidation induced by Abeta(25-35) was also reduced by oroxylin A. These results suggest that the amelioration of Abeta(25-35) peptide-induced memory impairment by oroxylin A is mediated via the GABAergic neurotransmitter system after a single administration  or by reductions in Abeta(25-35) peptide-induced astrocyte and microglia activations  iNOS expression  lipid peroxidation  and increased cholinergic neurotransmission after subchronic administration."

This phenomenon is associated with a reduced ability of CA3 to respond to entorhinal cortex inputs. Here  we describe a lesion that destroys the perforant path in CA3 after status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine injection in 8-week-old rats. Using magnetic resonance imaging  immunohistochemical  and ultrastructural analyses  we determined that this lesion develops after 30 minutes of SE and is characterized by microhemorrhages and ischemia. After a longer period of SE  the lesion invariably involves the upper blade of the dentate gyrus. Adult rats treated with subcutaneous diazepam (20 mg kg for 3 days) did not develop the dentate gyrus lesion and had less frequent spontaneous recurrent seizures (p &lt; 0.01). Young (3-week-old) rats rarely (20%) developed the CA3 lesion  and their spontaneous seizures were delayed (p &lt; 0.01). To investigate the role of the damaged CA3 in seizure activity  we reinduced SE in adult and young epileptic rats. Using FosB/DeltaFosB markers  we found induction of FosB/DeltaFosB immunopositivity in CA3 neurons of young but not in adult rats. These experiments indicate that SE can produce a focal lesion in the perforant path that may affect the roles of the hippocampus in epileptic rats."
"421","18582439","Characterization of stress-induced suppression of long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 field of freely moving rats.","Several lines of evidence have shown that exposure to stress impairs long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 field of the hippocampus  but the detailed mechanisms for this effect remain to be clarified. The present study elucidated the synaptic mechanism of stress-induced LTP suppression in conscious  freely moving rats using electrophysiological approaches. Open field stress (i.e.  novel environment stress) and elevated platform stress (i.e.  uncontrollable stress) were employed. Basal synaptic transmission was significantly reduced during exposure to elevated platform stress but not during exposure to open field stress. LTP induction was blocked by elevated platform stress but not influenced by open field stress. Significant increases in serum corticosterone levels were observed in the elevated platform stress group compared with the open field stress group. Furthermore  LTP suppression induced by elevated platform stress was prevented by pretreatment with an anxiolytic drug diazepam (1 mg/kg  i.p.). These results suggest that stress-induced LTP suppression depends on the relative intensity of the stressor. The inhibitory synaptic response induced by an intense psychological stress  such as elevated platform stress  may be attributable to LTP impairment in the CA1 field of the hippocampus."

We studied the effect on anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze of a dual FAAH/TRPV1 blocker  N-arachidonoyl-serotonin (AA-5-HT). In male C57BL/6J mice  acute intraperitoneal administration of AA-5-HT (0.1-2.5 mg/kg) increased both the time spent and the number of entries in the open arm  while being inactive at the highest dose tested (5 mg/kg). AA-5-HT was more potent than selective blockers of FAAH or TRPV1 (URB597 and SB366791  respectively). In male Swiss mice  AA-5-HT had to be administered chronically to observe an anxiolytic effect at an intermediate dose (2.5 mg/kg)  the highest dose (5 mg/kg) being anxiogenic  and 1 mg/kg being ineffective. In both strains  the anxiolytic effects of AA-5-HT were paralleled by elevation of brain endocannabinoid levels and were reversed by per se inactive doses of the cannabinoid receptors of type-1 (CB(1)) receptor antagonist AM251  or the TRPV1 agonist  olvanil. Immunohistochemical localization of CB(1) and TRPV1 receptors was observed in mouse prefrontal cortex  nucleus accumbens  amygdala  and hippocampus. Simultaneous 'indirect' activation of CB(1) receptors following FAAH inhibition  and antagonism at TRPV1 receptors might represent a new therapeutic strategy against anxiety."
"423","18563060","Long-lasting modulation of glutamatergic transmission in VTA dopamine neurons after a single dose of benzodiazepine agonists.","Initial effects of drugs of abuse seem to converge on the mesolimbic dopamine pathway originating from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Even after a single dose  many drugs of abuse are able to modulate the glutamatergic transmission activating the VTA dopamine neurons  which may represent a critical early stage in the development of addiction. Ligands acting on the benzodiazepine site of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors are known to be rewarding in animal models and have abuse liability in humans  but notably little evidence exists on the involvement of the mesolimbic dopamine system in their effects. Here we report that single in vivo doses of benzodiazepine-site agonists  similar to morphine and ethanol  induce a modulation in the glutamatergic transmission of VTA dopamine neurons. This is seen 24 h later as an increase in the ratio between alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitatory currents using whole-cell patch-clamp configuration in mouse VTA slices. The effect was due to increased frequency of spontaneous miniature AMPA receptor-mediated currents. It lasted at least 3 days after the injection of diazepam  and was prevented by coadministration of the benzodiazepine-site antagonist flumazenil or the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine. A single injection of the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit-preferring benzodiazepine-site ligand zolpidem also produced an increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio in VTA dopamine neurons. These findings suggest a role for the mesolimbic dopamine system in the initial actions of and on neuronal adaptation to benzodiazepines."

We found that RG-15 showed a good oral bioavailability (54%) and high brain levels (approx. 900 ng/g) in rats and demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy in amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and conditioned avoidance response tests in rats  yielding ED50 (median effective dose) values of 8.6 and 12 mg/kg orally  respectively. At six- to eightfold higher doses  RG-15 blocked spontaneous motor activity  while a 30 mg/kg dose of the compound caused an increase in the home-cage motility of rats. The drug did not produce catalepsy up to 160 mg/kg oral dose; moreover  it inhibited haloperidol-induced catalepsy in the range 15-60 mg/kg. RG-15 (10 mg/kg orally) restored the impaired learning performance of scopolamine- or diazepam-treated rats in a water-labyrinth paradigm. It is assumed that the motor activating  anticataleptic and cognitive-enhancing properties of RG-15 result from its potent D3 antagonism. In this regard  RG 15 clearly differs from other antipsychotics. Olanzapine  clozapine and amisulpride all showed efficacy against amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and on conditioned avoidance  but compared to RG-15  they proved to be more cataleptogenic and depressed or did not change the home-cage activity of animals. Olanzapine was also inactive in the learning paradigm. Our results suggest that subnanomolar dopamine D3 receptor antagonism coupled to moderate D2 affinity may result in an antipsychotic profile characterised by a lack of extrapyramidal side effects and secondary negative symptoms with simultaneous efficacy on positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia."

The impact of cannabinoid CB1 receptor blockade and inhibition of FAAH was evaluated in the elevated plus maze  rota-rod test  and models of unconditioned and conditioned social defeat.RESULTS: A characteristic heterogeneous distribution of cannabinoid receptors was detected in hamster brain using [3H]CP55 940 binding and autoradiography. The FAAH inhibitor URB597 inhibited FAAH activity (IC50 = 12.8 nM) and elevated levels of fatty-acid amides (N-palmitoyl ethanolamine and N-oleoyl ethanolamine) in hamster brain. Anandamide levels were not reliably altered. The cannabinoid agonist WIN55 212-2 (1- 10 mg/kg i.p.) induced CB1-mediated motor ataxia. Blockade of CB1 with rimonabant (5 mg/kg i.p.) induced anxiogenic-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. URB597 (0.1-0.3 mg/kg i.p.) induced CB1-mediated anxiolytic-like effects in the elevated plus maze  similar to the benzodiazepine diazepam (2 mg/kg i.p.). Diazepam (2-6 mg/kg i.p.) suppressed the expression  but not the acquisition  of conditioned defeat. By contrast  neither URB597 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg i.p.) nor rimonabant (5 mg/kg i.p.) altered unconditioned or conditioned social defeat or rota-rod performance.CONCLUSIONS: Endocannabinoids engage functional CB1 receptors in hamster brain to suppress anxiety-like behavior and undergo enzymatic hydrolysis catalyzed by FAAH. Our results further suggest that neither unconditioned nor conditioned social defeat in the Syrian hamster is dependent upon cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation."

The low content of diazepam (0.04 +/- 0.01 mg/kg) determined by HPLC and mass spectrometry in the potato extracts could not sustain the anticonvulsant activity of potato juice in vivo; therefore we hypothesized that potato juice might contain GABA (A) receptor GABA-site active compounds.

Their inactivation is associated with anxiolytic and antidepressive properties but little information is available concerning cognition. This issue was addressed using the selective antagonists  SNAP-7941 and GW3430  in a social recognition paradigm in rats. The muscarinic blocker  scopolamine (1.25 mg/kg s.c.)  reduced social recognition  an action dose-dependently blocked by SNAP-7941 and GW3430 (0.63-10.0 and 20.0-80.0 mg/kg i.p.  respectively) which did not themselves display amnesic properties. Further  in a protocol where a spontaneous deficit was induced by a prolonged inter-session delay  SNAP-7941 and GW3430 dose-dependently enhanced social recognition. In dialysis studies  SNAP-7941 (0.63-40.0 mg/kg i.p.) and GW3430 (10.0-40.0 mg/kg i.p.) elevated extracellular levels of acetylcholine (ACh) in the frontal cortex (FCX) of freely moving rats. The SNAP-7941 effect was specific  as it did not increase levels of ACh in ventral and dorsal hippocampus: moreover  it did not modify levels of noradrenaline  dopamine  serotonin and glutamate in FCX. Active doses of SNAP-7941 and GW3430 corresponded to doses (2.5-40.0 and 10.0-80.0 mg/kg i.p.  respectively) exerting anxiolytic properties in Vogel conflict and ultrasonic vocalization tests  and antidepressant actions in forced swim  isolation-induced aggression and marble-burying procedures. In contrast to SNAP-7941 and GW3430  the benzodiazepine  diazepam  decreased social recognition and dialysate levels of ACh  while the tricyclic  imipramine  reduced social recognition and failed to enhance cholinergic transmission. In conclusion  at anxiolytic and antidepressant doses  SNAP-7941 and GW3430 improve social recognition and elevate extracellular ACh levels in FCX. This profile differentiates MCH1 receptor antagonists from conventional anxiolytic and antidepressant agents."

In intact cells  GABA and the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol caused a rapid and transient increase in intracellular calcium  whereas the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen was ineffective  suggesting that chloride-mediated depolarization activates voltage-gated calcium channels. Consistent with this finding  RT-PCR analysis indicated high expression of NKCC1  but not KCC2 cation/chloride transporter mRNAs in pituitary cells. Furthermore  the GABA(A) channel reversal potential for chloride ions was positive to the baseline membrane potential in most cells and the activation of ion channels by GABA resulted in depolarization of cells and modulation of spontaneous electrical activity. These results indicate that secretory pituitary cells express functional GABA(A) receptor-channels that are depolarizing."

The procedure was checked with radiolabeled markers in oxygenated bicarbonate-buffered fluid infused for 30 to 120 sec via a carotid artery. Vascular flow estimated with diazepam was 2.2-fold lower in the eye than in the brain. The vascular volume and the integrity markers sucrose and inulin indicated that a perfusion flow rate of 2.5 mL/min preserved the physical integrity of these organs. However  the brain vasculature integrity was more sensitive to acute perfusion pressure than the eye vasculature. The functional capacities of blood barriers were assessed with D-glucose; its transport followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent K(m) of 7.6 mmol/L and a V(max) of 23 micromol/sec per g in the brain  and a K(m) of 22.9 mmol/L and a V(max) of 40 micromol/sec per g in the eye. The transport of cholesterol to the brain and eye was significantly enhanced by adding the Abca1 inhibitor probucol  suggesting an Abca1-mediated efflux at the mouse brain and eye blood barriers. Thus in situ carotid perfusion is suitable for elucidating transport processes at the blood-brain and blood-eye barriers."

Many herbs have been reported to exhibit properties that combat oxidative stress through their active constituents such as flavonoids  tannins  phenolic compounds etc. Cytisus scoparius (CS) Link  (Family: Leguminosae)  also called Sarothamnus scoparius  has been shown in invitro experiments to be endowed with anti-diabetic  hypnotic and sedative and antioxidant activity. Therefore this study was carried out to evaluate CS for its anxiolytic  antidepressant and anti-oxidant activity in stressed rats.METHODS: 60% methanolic extract of CS was quantified for phenolic content by Folin-Ciocalteau's method. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CMS) was employed to induce stress in rats. CS (125 and 250 mg/kg  p.o) and diazepam (DZM) (2 mg/kg  p.o) was administered during the 21 day stress exposure period. Anxiolytic and antidepressant activities of CS were assessed in open field exploratory and behavioural despair paradigms  respectively. Plasma glucose and total lipids; endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD)  catalase (CAT); non-enzymic-ascorbic acid and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels were measured in brain  kidneys and adrenals using standard protocols to assess the effect of CS.RESULTS: Total phenolic content of CS was found to be 8.54 +/- 0.16% w/w. CMS produced anxiogenic and depressive behaviour in experimental rats with metabolic disturbance. Significant decrease in SOD  CAT levels and increase in lipid peroxidation level was observed in stressed rats. CS administration for 21 days during stress exposure significantly increased the ambulatory behaviour and decreased the freezing time in open field behaviour. In behavioural despair test no significant alteration in the immobility period was observed. CS also improved SOD  CAT  and ascorbic acid level and controlled the lipid peroxidation in different tissues.CONCLUSION: CS possesses anti-stress and moderate anxiolytic activity which may be due  in part  to its antioxidant effect that might warrant further studies."
"433","18420937","The antidepressant fluoxetine restores plasticity in the adult visual cortex.","We investigated whether fluoxetine  a widely prescribed medication for treatment of depression  restores neuronal plasticity in the adult visual system of the rat. We found that chronic administration of fluoxetine reinstates ocular dominance plasticity in adulthood and promotes the recovery of visual functions in adult amblyopic animals  as tested electrophysiologically and behaviorally. These effects were accompanied by reduced intracortical inhibition and increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the visual cortex. Cortical administration of diazepam prevented the effects induced by fluoxetine  indicating that the reduction of intracortical inhibition promotes visual cortical plasticity in the adult. Our results suggest a potential clinical application for fluoxetine in amblyopia as well as new mechanisms for the therapeutic effects of antidepressants and for the pathophysiology of mood disorders."
"434","18407251","GABA homeostasis contributes to the developmental programming of anxiety-related behavior.","During development  when inhibitory and excitatory synapses are formed and refined  homeostatic mechanisms act to adjust inhibitory input in order to maintain neural activity within a normal range. As the brain matures  synaptogenesis slows and a relatively stable level of inhibition is achieved. Deficits in inhibitory neurotransmission are associated with increased anxiety-related behavior and drugs that potentiate GABA function  the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain  are effective anxiolytics. These observations raise the possibility that transient perturbations in the activity of neural circuits during development might induce compensatory changes in inhibition that could persist into adulthood and contribute to changes in anxiety-related behavior. To test this hypothesis  we treated mice continuously during the major period of forebrain synaptogenesis (P14-28) with the GABA-A receptor positive modulator diazepam and assessed anxiety-related behavior in adulthood. Control experiments confirmed anxiolytic effects of the drug following one day of treatment and the development of tolerance following two weeks of treatment. When tested in adulthood  one month after the end of treatment  diazepam-treated mice exhibited significantly increased behavioral inhibition in the open-field  elevated-plus maze  and novel object behavioral paradigms. Levels of benzodiazepine binding sites in amygdala and frontal cortex were specifically decreased in diazepam-treated mice demonstrating that homeostatic adjustments in GABA function persist into adulthood. Our results show that increased GABAergic activity can affect the developmental programming of anxiety-related behavior."

PBMEC/C1-2 and ECV304 cells were cultured in several media with different compositions on Transwell inserts. Inducibility and functionality of tightness were investigated by transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and by transport studies with transcellular marker diazepam  glycine antagonist Bu101 and paracellular marker APTS-dextran. Inducibility  expression and localization of tight junctional proteins were assessed by western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Presence of factors derived from glioma cell line C6 resulted in increased TEER in both cell lines. Comparison to APTS-dextran data across Caco-2 layers emphasized that correlations between permeability of the paracellular marker and TEER are dependent on each investigated cell line and the corresponding growth medium. Presence and inducibility of tight junctional proteins ZO-1 and Occludin were proven for ECV304 layers. Cell line ECV304 seemed to be suitable for TEER dependent transport studies  whereas PBMEC/C1-2 showed higher potential for P-gP studies."

Mechanisms of intractability are not well understood  but may include limitation of antiepileptic drug access to the seizure focus by overexpression of the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp) at the blood-brain barrier. Increased expression of Pgp has been determined both in epileptogenic brain tissue of patients with intractable epilepsy and in rodent models of temporal lobe epilepsy  including the pilocarpine model. The mechanisms underlying the increase of Pgp after seizures are unclear. We have recently suggested that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate  which is excessively released by seizures  is involved in the seizure-induced overexpression of Pgp in the brain. This hypothesis was evaluated in the present study in the pilocarpine model in rats. After 90 min of status epilepticus (SE)  diazepam was administered  followed by either vehicle or the glutamate receptor antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine). Following SE in vehicle treated rats  Pgp expression in brain capillary endothelial cells increased about twofold in the hippocampus  which was completely prevented by MK-801. Furthermore  neurodegeneration developing in the hippocampus and parahippocampal regions was reduced by the glutamate antagonist. In contrast  the Pgp inhibitor tariquidar did not affect the SE-induced overexpression of Pgp or neurodegeneration in most regions examined. The data indicate that seizure-induced glutamate release is involved in the regulation of Pgp expression  which can be blocked by MK-801. The finding that MK-801 counteracts both Pgp overexpression and neuronal damage when administered after SE may offer a clinically useful therapeutic option in patients with refractory SE."

Of the various methods used for inducing experimental epileptic models  the intracortical administration of ferric chloride (FeCl(3)) into sensorimotor cortex induces recurrent seizures and epileptic discharge similar to human post-traumatic epilepsy through the generation of free radicals. The present study focuses on the effect of Acorus calamus on the behavioral  electroencephalographic  and antioxidant changes in FeCl(3)-induced rat epileptogenesis. Topical administration of FeCl(3) (5 microL; 100 mM) into the sensorimotor cortex of rats showed an increase in the wet dog shake behavior  spike wave discharges together with an significant increase in antioxidant enzyme activity  such as superoxide dismutase and catalase  resulting in an increase in the level of lipid peroxidation in cerebral cortex. Pretreatment with Acorus calamus (200 mg/kg b.w.  p.o. for 14 days) and also diazepam (DZ  20 mg/kg b.w.  i.p.) decreased the WDS behavior  spike wave discharges with single isolated positive waves  and a significant decrease in activity of superoxide dismutase and level of lipid peroxidation was observed in cerebral cortex with respect to those observed in FeCl(3)-induced epileptic group. Data presented in this study clearly show that Acorus calamus possesses the ability for preventing the development of FeCl(3)-induced epileptogenesis by modulating antioxidant enzymes  which in turn exhibit the potentiality of Acorus calamus to be developed as an effective anti-epileptic drug."
"438","18374306","Varying magnitude of GABAergic recurrent inhibition enhancement by different sedative/anesthetic agents in dorsal and ventral hippocampus.","The positive modulation of the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) is presumably one of the main mechanisms by which several sedatives mediate their actions in the central nervous system. This modulation appears to depend on the presence of alpha and beta GABA(A)R subunits  whose distinct expression in dorsal and ventral hippocampus has been recently shown. Using population spike recordings from the CA1 area of dorsal (DHS) and ventral (VHS) hippocampal slices we compared the effects of seven sedative/anesthetic drugs (diazepam  midazolam  phenobarbital  propofol  pentobarbital  thiopental and alfaxalone) on the GABAergic recurrent inhibition (RI) between the two hippocampal poles. The strength and duration of RI was quantified by measuring an antidromic stimulation-induced suppression of the orthodromic population spike at varying inter-pulse intervals. All drugs enhanced RI in both DHS and VHS but high concentrations of barbiturates and alfaxalone prolonged RI considerably more compared to benzodiazepines or low doses of barbiturates and propofol. Furthermore  the drug-induced prolongation of RI was significantly greater in DHS than in VHS. Thus  RI was enhanced by thiopental (50 microM)  alfaxalone (2.5 microM) and pentobarbital (50 microM) up to 150 ms  150 ms and 270 ms respectively in DHS  and up to 70 ms  100 ms and 150 ms respectively in VHS. In addition  under GABA(B) receptor blockade  thiopental (100 microM) and alfaxalone (10 microM) prolonged GABA(A)R-mediated RI significantly more in DH (up to 900 ms) than in VH (up to 430 ms and 600 ms respectively). This finding provides support to the notion of diversification of intrinsic organization along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. Finally  an interesting link was revealed between the magnitude of drug-induced enhancement of RI and the reported sedative potency of the drugs used  suggesting that deep sedation and anesthesia may involve prolongation of GABAergic inhibition."
"439","18364065","Juvenile stress-induced alteration of maturation of the GABAA receptor alpha subunit in the rat.","Profound evidence indicates that GABAA receptors are important in the control of physiological response to stress and anxiety. The alpha subunit type composition contributes significantly to the functional characterization of the GABAA receptors. The alpha2  alpha3  alpha5 subunits are predominately expressed in the brain during embryonic and early postnatal periods of normal rats  whilst alpha1 are most prominent during later developmental stages. In the present study  we examined the long-term effects of juvenile stress on GABA alpha subunit expression in adulthood in the amygdala and hippocampus. We applied the elevated platform stress paradigm at juvenility and used the open-field and startle response tests to assess anxiety level in adulthood. Juvenile stress effects without behavioural tests in adulthood were also examined since previous studies indicated that the mere exposure to these tests might be stressful for rats  enhancing the effects of the juvenile exposure to stress. In adulthood  we quantitatively determined the level of expression of alpha1  alpha2 and alpha3 in the hippocampus and amygdala. Our results indicate that subjecting juvenile stressed rats to additional challenges in adulthood results in an immature-like expression profile of these subunits. To test for potential functional implications of these alterations we examined the effects of the anxiolytic (diazepam) and the sedative (brotizolam) benzodiazepines on juvenile stressed and control rats following additional challenges in adulthood. Juvenile stressed rats were more sensitive to diazepam and less sensitive to brotizolam  suggesting that the alterations in GABA alpha subunit expression in these animals have functional consequences."

Its impact on newborn breathing has not been documented despite potential deleterious consequences for later brain development. We addressed this issue in neonatal rats (0-2 d) born from dams  which consumed 2 mg/kg/d diazepam via drinking fluid throughout gestation. In vivo  prenatal diazepam exposure significantly altered the normoxic-breathing pattern  lowering breathing frequency (105 vs. 125 breaths/min) and increasing tidal volume (16.2 vs. 12.7 mL/kg)  and the ventilatory response to hypoxia  inducing an immediate and marked decrease in tidal volume (-30%) absent in controls. In vitro  prenatal diazepam exposure significantly increased the respiratory-like frequency produced by pontomedullary and medullary preparations (+38% and +19%  respectively) and altered the respiratory-like response to application of nonoxygenated superfusate. Both in vivo and in vitro  the recovery from oxygen deprivation challenges was delayed by prenatal diazepam exposure. Finally  real-time PCR showed that prenatal diazepam exposure affected mRNA levels of alpha1 and alpha2 GABAA receptor subunits and of A1 and A2A adenosine receptors in the brainstem. These mRNA changes  which are region-specific  suggest that prenatal diazepam exposure interferes with developmental events whose impact on the respiratory system maturation deserves further studies."

Deletion of alpha2-containing receptors abolishes cocaine-induced behavioural sensitisation (BS)  while selective activation of alpha2 receptors  achieved using Ro 15-4513's agonist properties in alpha2(H101R) mice  induced BS. Here  we investigate further the mechanisms underlying Ro 15-4513-induced behavioural sensitisation in alpha2(H101R) mice. alpha2(H101R) mice sensitised to Ro 15-4513 (10 mg/kg) showed an enhanced stimulant response to cocaine (10 mg/kg). In contrast  cocaine (10 mg/kg)-sensitised alpha2(H101R) mice did not show enhanced sensitivity to the stimulant effects of Ro 15-4513 (1  3 and 10 mg/kg)  suggesting that the neural adaptations underlying Ro 15-4513 induced BS are related to  but not identical with those associated with cocaine-induced plasticity. Secondly  we investigated whether alpha2-containing receptors are involved in mediating the ability of BZs to facilitate cocaine-induced activity. The non-selective (i.e.  alpha1  alpha2  alpha3 and alpha5 subtype) benzodiazepine GABA(A) receptor agonist midazolam (10 and 30 mg/kg) potentiated cocaine (10 mg/kg) hyperactivity in wildtype mice  but not in alpha2(H101R) mice  in which alpha2-containing receptors are insensitive to benzodiazepines. To determine where alpha2 receptors are localised we compared BZ-insensitive sites between wildtype (alpha4 and alpha6) and alpha2(H101R) (alpha2  alpha4 and alpha6) mice  using quantitative autoradiography to estimate [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 binding in the presence of 10 muM diazepam. alpha2 receptors were found in projection areas of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway including accumbens  central amygdala  and basolateral amygdala as well as CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus. The involvement of the alpha2-containing receptor in mediating BZ's potentiating effect on cocaine hyperactivity suggests that the locomotor stimulant effects of BZs and psychostimulants may be mediated by a common neural system  but the lack of cross sensitisation to Ro 15-4513 in cocaine-sensitised alpha2(H101R) mice  suggests that this form of BS may occur downstream of plastic events underlying cocaine sensitisation."

Recently  we developed a new nonpeptide agonist of the NOP receptor  1-[1-(1-methylcyclooctyl)-4-piperidinyl]-2-[(3R)-3-piperidinyl]-1H-benzimidazole (MCOPPB)  as an anxiolytic agent. MCOPPB has a high affinity for the human NOP receptor (pKi = 10.07 +/- 0.01) and selectivity for the NOP receptor over other members of the opioid receptor family: 12-  270- and &gt;1000-fold more selective for the NOP receptor than for the micro-  kappa-  and delta-receptor  respectively. In an ex vivo binding study  MCOPPB (10 mg/kg  p.o.) inhibited signaling through the NOP receptor in the mouse brain  suggesting that it penetrated into the brain after it was orally administered. In the mouse Vogel conflict test  MCOPPB (10 mg/kg  p.o.) and diazepam (3 mg/kg  p.o.) elicited anxiolytic-like effects  although MCOPPB produced a bell-shaped response curve. In addition  MCOPPB (10 mg/kg  p.o.) was still effective as an anxiolytic agent even after repeated administration for 5 days. MCOPPB at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg did not affect locomotor activity or memory  nor did it contribute to ethanol-induced hypnosis. On the other hand  the benzodiazepine-type anxiolytic agent diazepam caused memory deficits and enhanced ethanol-induced hypnosis. These findings suggest that MCOPPB - a compound with few adverse effects on the central nervous system - is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of anxiety."

Male rats were daily submitted to 10-20 min of either forced swimming or sham swimming (SS) for 3 consecutive days. Two days later  spinal GABA release was estimated by in vivo microdialysis. In other set of rats  either diazepam (2 mg/kg  i.p.) or saline was administered 1h before either SS or FS and inflammatory nociception was assessed with the formalin test; it was followed by removal of lumbar spinal cords for c-Fos immunocytochemistry. Basal and pain-evoked release of GABA in the spinal cord was lower in FS rats than in SS rats. In contrast  pain scores during formalin test late phase and pain-induced c-Fos expression in laminae I-VI of ipsilateral dorsal horn were significantly higher in FS rats than in SS rats. In FS rats  diazepam did not have effect on GABA release but reduced pain scores and overexpression of c-Fos whereas flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg  i.p.)  an antagonist of the benzodiazepine binding site  reversed these effects. When diazepam was given only 1h before the formalin test  it slightly but significantly reduced pain scores during late phase in FS rats but not in SS rats. In conclusion  stress-induced reduction in GABA-A receptor activation is involved in the development of FS stress-induced hyperalgesia."

We previously showed that antidepressants increased glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression  which was dependent on acute activation of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in rat C6 glioma cells (C6 cells) and normal human astrocytes (NHA). Transcription of many genes including GDNF is directed by the cAMP responsive element (CRE) and its cognate transcription factor CRE binding protein (CREB). In this study  we showed that amitriptyline  a tricyclic antidepressant  acutely increased phosphorylation of CREB  without altering the level of total CREB in C6 cells as well as in NHA. In contrast  acute amitriptyline treatment did not affect phosphorylation of CREB in SH-SY5Y cells  a human neuroblastoma cell line. Different classes of antidepressants as well as amitriptyline acutely increased phosphorylation of CREB  but haloperidol and diazepam did not. The amitriptyline-induced phosphorylation of CREB was completely blocked by U0126 [a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase 1 inhibitor] and genistein (a PTK inhibitor)  but not by inhibitors of protein kinase A  p38 MAP kinase  or Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase. Amitriptyline treatment also increased the expression of luciferase reporter gene regulated by CRE elements. The amitriptyline-induced luciferase activity was completely inhibited by U0126 in the same as phosphorylation of CREB. These results suggest that antidepressants acutely increase CREB activity in PTK and ERK-dependent manners  which might contribute to gene expression including GDNF in glial cells."

The main drugs are anticholinergics that antagonize the effects of accumulated acetylcholine at the cholinergic synapses and cholinesterase reactivators (oximes) reactivating inhibited AChE. Anticonvulsants such as diazepam are also used to treat convulsions. Though there are experimental data on a good therapeutic effects of reactivators  some attempts to underestimate the role of reactivators as effective antidotes against OP poisoning have been made.

This study compared the influences of mu-opioid receptor (MOR) activation in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) on unconditioned fear or anxiety-like responses in two models  the elevated plus maze  and the defensive burying test. The role of MORs in the anxiolytic actions of the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam was also examined using both models. Either the MOR agonist [D-Ala(2)  NMe-Phe(4)  Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin (DAMGO)  or the MOR antagonists Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH(2) (CTAP) or beta-funaltrexamine (FNA) were bilaterally infused into the CEA of rats before testing. The results show that microinjection of DAMGO in the CEA decreased open-arm time in the plus maze  whereas CTAP increased open-arm behaviors. In contrast  DAMGO injections in the CEA reduced burying behaviors and increased rearing following exposure to a predator odor  suggesting a shift in the behavioral response in this context. Amygdala injections of the MOR agonist DAMGO or the MOR antagonist CTAP failed to change the anxiolytic effects of diazepam in either test. Our results demonstrate that MOR activation in the central amygdala exerts distinctive effects in two different models of unconditioned fear or anxiety-like responses  and suggest that opioids may exert context-specific regulation of amygdalar output circuits and behavioral responses during exposure to potential threats (open arms of the maze) vs discrete threats (predator odor)."
"448","18202657","Reversal of pathological pain through specific spinal GABAA receptor subtypes.","Inflammatory diseases and neuropathic insults are frequently accompanied by severe and debilitating pain  which can become chronic and often unresponsive to conventional analgesic treatment. A loss of synaptic inhibition in the spinal dorsal horn is considered to contribute significantly to this pain pathology. Facilitation of spinal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission through modulation of GABA(A) receptors should be able to compensate for this loss. With the use of GABA(A)-receptor point-mutated knock-in mice in which specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes have been selectively rendered insensitive to benzodiazepine-site ligands  we show here that pronounced analgesia can be achieved by specifically targeting spinal GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha2 and/or alpha3 subunits. We show that their selective activation by the non-sedative ('alpha1-sparing') benzodiazepine-site ligand L-838 417 (ref. 13) is highly effective against inflammatory and neuropathic pain yet devoid of unwanted sedation  motor impairment and tolerance development. L-838 417 not only diminished the nociceptive input to the brain but also reduced the activity of brain areas related to the associative-emotional components of pain  as shown by functional magnetic resonance imaging in rats. These results provide a rational basis for the development of subtype-selective GABAergic drugs for the treatment of chronic pain  which is often refractory to classical analgesics."

Using transgenic (tg) mice expressing a dominant-negative activin receptor mutant under the control of the CaMKIIalpha promoter in forebrain neurons  we identified activin as a key regulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synapses and anxiety-like behavior. In the open field  wild-type (wt) and tg mice did not differ in spontaneous locomotion and exploration behavior. However  tg mice visited inner fields significantly more often than wt mice. In the light-dark exploration test  tg mice made more exits  spent significantly more time on a well-lit elevated bar and went farther away from the dark box as compared to wt mice. In addition  the anxiolytic effect of diazepam was abrogated in tg mice. Thus the disruption of activin receptor signaling produced a low-anxiety phenotype that failed to respond to benzodiazepines. In whole-cell recordings from hippocampal pyramidal cells  enhanced spontaneous GABA release  increased GABA tonus  reduced benzodiazepine sensitivity and augmented GABA(B) receptor function emerged as likely substrates of the low-anxiety phenotype. These data provide strong evidence that activin influences pre- and postsynaptic components of GABAergic synapses in a highly synergistic fashion. Given the crucial role of GABAergic neurotransmission in emotional states  anxiety and depression  dysfunctions of activin receptor signaling could be involved in affective disorders: and drugs affecting this pathway might show promise for psychopharmacological treatment."

We examined the effect of chronic administration of MAP on the mRNA expression of DBI and DBI-related proteins  such as alpha 2 subunit of GABAA receptor (GABA-a2)  peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)  and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) in seven regions (diencephalon  cerebral cortex  cerebellum  striatum  hippocampus  midbrain  and pons-medulla) of the rat brain. The mRNA expression of DBI increased significantly in all areas of the brain  especially diencephalon  after chronic administration of MAP. The mRNA expression of PBR  GABA-a2 and PACAP increased significantly in all areas of the brain  especially cerebral cortex  after chronic administration of MAP. These results suggest that anxiety is associated with the mRNA expression of DBI as well as DBI-related genes."
"452","18155072","Antipsychotics increase vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) expression in thalamolimbic pathways.","Recently the two vesicular-glutamate-transporters VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 have been cloned and characterized. VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 together label all glutamatergic neurons  but because of their distinct expression patterns in the brain they facilitate our ability to define between a VGLUT1-positive cortical and a VGLUT2-positive subcortical glutamatergic systems. We have previously demonstrated an increased cortical VGLUT1 expression as marker of antidepressant activity. Here  we assessed the effects of different psychotropic drugs on brain VGLUT2 mRNA and protein expression. The typical antipsychotic haloperidol  and the atypicals clozapine and risperidone increased VGLUT2 mRNA selectively in the central medial/medial parafascicular  paraventricular and intermediodorsal thalamic nuclei; VGLUT2 protein was accordingly amplified in paraventricular and ventral striatum and in prefrontal cortex. The antidepressants fluoxetine and desipramine and the sedative anxiolytic diazepam had no effect. These results highlight the implication of thalamo-limbic glutamatergic pathways in the action of antipsychotics. Increased VGLUT2 expression in these neurons might constitute a marker for antipsychotic activity and subcortical glutamate neurotransmission might be a possible novel target for future generation antipsychotics."
"453","18079158","The expression of GABAA beta subunit isoforms in synaptic and extrasynaptic receptor populations of mouse dentate gyrus granule cells.","The subunit composition of GABA(A) receptors influences their biophysical and pharmacological properties  dictates neuronal location and the interaction with associated proteins  and markedly influences the impact of intracellular biochemistry. The focus has been on alpha and gamma subunits  with little attention given to beta subunits. Dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs) express all three beta subunit isoforms and exhibit both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors that mediate 'phasic' and 'tonic' transmission  respectively. To investigate the subcellular distribution of the beta subunits we have utilized the patch-clamp technique to compare the properties of 'tonic' and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) recorded from DGGCs of hippocampal slices of P20-26 wild-type (WT)  beta(2)(-/-)  beta(2N265S) (etomidate-insensitive)  alpha(1)(-/-) and delta(-/-) mice. Deletion of either the beta(2) or the delta subunit produced a significant reduction of the tonic current and attenuated the increase of this current induced by the delta subunit-preferring agonist 4 5 6 7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5 4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP). By contrast  mIPSCs were not influenced by deletion of these genes. Enhancement of the tonic current by the beta(2/3) subunit-selective agent etomidate was significantly reduced for DGGCs derived from beta(2N265S) mice  whereas this manipulation had no effect on the prolongation of mIPSCs produced by this anaesthetic. Collectively  these observations  together with previous studies on alpha(4)(-/-) mice  identify a population of extrasynaptic alpha(4)beta(2)delta receptors  whereas synaptic GABA(A) receptors appear to primarily incorporate the beta(3) subunit. A component of the tonic current is diazepam sensitive and is mediated by extrasynaptic receptors incorporating alpha(5) and gamma(2) subunits. Deletion of the beta(2) subunit had no effect on the diazepam-induced current and therefore these extrasynaptic receptors do not contain this subunit. The unambiguous identification of these distinct pools of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors should aid our understanding of how they act in harmony  to regulate hippocampal signalling in health and disease."

During postnatal development  marked changes in subunit expression occur  presumably reflecting changes in functional properties of neuronal networks. The aims of this study were to characterize the properties of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors of developing VB neurones and investigate the role of the alpha(1) subunit during maturation of GABA-ergic transmission  using electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry in wild type (WT) and alpha(1)(0/0) mice and mice engineered to express diazepam-insensitive receptors (alpha(1H101R)  alpha(2H101R)). In immature brain  rapid (P8/9-P10/11) developmental change to mIPSC kinetics and increased expression of extrasynaptic receptors (P8-27) formed by the alpha(4) and delta subunit occurred independently of the alpha(1) subunit. Subsequently (&gt; or = P15)  synaptic alpha(2) subunit/gephyrin clusters of WT VB neurones were replaced by those containing the alpha(1) subunit. Surprisingly  in alpha(1)(0/0) VB neurones the frequency of mIPSCs decreased between P12 and P27  because the alpha(2) subunit also disappeared from these cells. The loss of synaptic GABA(A) receptors led to a delayed disruption of gephyrin clusters. Despite these alterations  GABA-ergic terminals were preserved  perhaps maintaining tonic inhibition. These results demonstrate that maturation of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors in VB follows a developmental programme independent of the alpha(1) subunit. Changes to synaptic GABA(A) receptor function and the increased expression of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors represent two distinct mechanisms for fine-tuning GABA-ergic control of thalamic relay neurone activity during development."
"455","18056985","Adaptation to hypobaric hypoxia involves GABA A receptors in the pons.","Survival in low-oxygen environments requires adaptation of sympathorespiratory control networks located in the brain stem. The molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation are unclear. In naïve animals  acute hypoxia evokes increases in phrenic (respiratory) and splanchnic (sympathetic) nerve activities that persist after repeated challenges (long-term facilitation  LTF). In contrast  our studies show that conditioning rats to chronic hypobaric hypoxia (CHH)  an environment characteristic of living at high altitude  diminishes the response to hypoxia and attenuates LTF in a time-dependent manner. Phrenic LTF decreases following 7 days of CHH  and both sympathetic and phrenic LTF disappear following 14 days of CHH. Previous studies demonstrated that GABA is released in the brain stem during hypoxia and depresses respiratory activity. Furthermore  the sensitivity of brain stem neurons to GABA is increased following prolonged hypoxia. In this study  we demonstrate that GABA(A) receptor expression changes along with the CHH-induced physiological changes. Expression of the GABA(A) receptor alpha4 subunit mRNA increases two-fold in animals conditioned to CHH for 7 days. In addition  de novo expression of delta and alpha6  a subunit normally found exclusively in the cerebellum  is observed after 14 days. Consistent with these changes  diazepam-insensitive binding sites  characteristic of GABA(A) receptors containing alpha4 and alpha6 subunits  increase in the pons. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CHH-induced GABA(A) receptor subunit expression is localized in regions of sympathorespiratory control within the pons. Our findings suggest that a GABA(A) receptor mediated-mechanism participates in adaptation of the sympathorespiratory system to hypobaric hypoxia."
"456","18045761","Treatment with haloperidol and diazepam alters GABA(A) receptor density in the rat brain.","A significant body of data suggests that GABA(A) receptors are altered in the CNS of subjects with schizophrenia. However  subjects with schizophrenia are treated with antipsychotic drugs and  in some cases  antipsychotic drugs and benzodiazepines. It has therefore been suggested that the changes in GABA(A) receptors in the CNS of subjects with schizophrenia are due to such drug treatments. Surprisingly  there appear to be no studies to determine the effect of a combined antipsychotic-benzodiazepine treatment on GABA(A) receptors. We therefore measured both the GABA binding site ([3H]muscimol) and the benzodiazepine binding site ([3H]flumazenil) in the CNS of rats treated with either haloperidol  diazepam or a combination of the two drugs. The main findings of our study are that treatment with diazepam or the combination of diazepam and haloperidol results in regionally selective increases GABA binding sites but treatment with haloperidol alone decreases the GABA binding site in the thalamus but increases these sites in the hypothalamus. By contrast  treatment with diazepam  haloperidol and a combination of the two drugs resulted in widespread decreases in the number of benzodiazepine binding sites in the rat CNS. The notable exception to this outcome was increased numbers of benzodiazepine binding sites in the frontal cortex of rats that had received diazepam. Our data suggests that there are complex changes in the GABA(A) receptor following treatment with haloperidol  diazepam or a combination of these drugs. This outcome may be relevant to the therapeutic benefits of using both drugs in conjunction early in the treatment of a psychotic episode."

All studies conducted on stress-immune relationships  however  provide from physical and/or psychological stressors. Indeed  as far as it is of our knowledge brain-innate immune responses were not analyzed after anxiogenic-like drugs use. The present experiment was then undertaken to analyze the effects of picrotoxin (0.3  0.6 and 1.0mg/kg doses) on behavior  macrophage activity  serum corticosterone and noradrenaline (NE) levels and turnover in the brain of adult mice. Results showed that picrotoxin treatment in mice: (1) decreased motor and rearing activities in an open-field; (2) decreased the number of entries into the plus-maze open-arms and decreased the time spent in the exploration of the plus-maze open-arms; (3) decreased both motor activity and the level of holes exploration in the hole-board; (4) increased the levels of serum corticosterone in dose-dependent way; (5) increased noradrenaline (NE) and MHPG levels and NE turnover in the hypothalamus; and (6) increased Staphylococcus aureus and PMA-induced macrophage oxidative burst. However  and contrary to that reported after physical or psychological stress  this drug induced no effects on macrophage phagocytosis and NE levels and turnover in the frontal cortex. The present results are thus showing that picrotoxin induces some but not all neuro-innate immunity changes previously reported for inescapable foot-shock and psychological stressors in mice. These facts suggest that this chemical stressor triggers CNS pathways that might be somehow different from those fired by inescapable foot-shock and psychological stressors  leading to different neuro-innate immune responses."

The current study investigated a mechanism for loss of neurosteroid sensitivity of synaptic GABA(A) receptors in TLE. Synaptic currents recorded from DGCs of epileptic animals (epileptic DGCs) were less frequent  larger in amplitude  and less sensitive to allopregnanolone modulation than those recorded from DGCs of control animals (control DGCs). Synaptic currents recorded from epileptic DGCs were less sensitive to diazepam and had altered sensitivity to benzodiazepine inverse agonist RO 15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1 5alpha][1 4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) and furosemide than those recorded from control DGCs. Properties of synaptic currents recorded from epileptic DGCs appeared similar to those of recombinant receptors containing the alpha4 subunit. Expression of the alpha4 subunit and its colocalization with the synaptic marker GAD65 was increased in epileptic DGCs. Location of the alpha4 subunit in relation to symmetric (inhibitory) synapses on soma and dendrites of control and epileptic DGCs was examined with postembedding immunogold electron microscopy. The alpha4 immunogold labeling was present more commonly within the synapse in epileptic DGCs compared with control DGCs  in which the subunit was extrasynaptic. These studies demonstrate that  in epileptic DGCs  the neurosteroid modulation of synaptic currents is diminished and alpha4 subunit-containing receptors are present at synapses and participate in synaptic transmission. These changes may facilitate seizures in epileptic animals."

PCPB bound to the NOP receptor in mouse brain membranes (Ki=0.12 nM) and to recombinant human NOP receptor (Ki=2.1 nM). PCPB showed full agonism for the NOP receptor in isolated mouse vas deferens with a maximal effect and high potency that were similar to the pharmacological profile observed for nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) (pD(2): 6.9+/-0.2; 95+/-2% activity). Orally administered PCPB (30 mg/kg) penetrated well into the brains of the mice. PCPB exhibited an anxiolytic activity in mice subjected to the Vogel conflict test that was comparable to the maximal response induced by diazepam  a representative anxiolytic agent. The anxiolytic effect of PCPB was dose-dependently blocked by the NOP receptor antagonist  J-113397  demonstrating that this effect was mediated by the NOP receptor agonist activity. Behavioral studies in mice also showed that PCPB prolonged the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time but did not cause muscle relaxation at the oral anxiolytic dose of 30 mg/kg. Unlike diazepam  however  these central effects of PCPB were weak. Our results indicate that PCPB is a potent anxiolytic agent with agonistic activities for the NOP receptor."
"460","17965197","Cortical glutamatergic neurons mediate the motor sedative action of diazepam.","The neuronal circuits mediating the sedative action of diazepam are unknown. Although the motor-depressant action of diazepam is suppressed in alpha1(H101R) homozygous knockin mice expressing diazepam-insensitive alpha1-GABA(A) receptors  global alpha1-knockout mice show greater motor sedation with diazepam. To clarify this paradox  attributed to compensatory up-regulation of the alpha2 and alpha3 subunits  and to further identify the neuronal circuits supporting diazepam-induced sedation  we generated Emx1-cre-recombinase-mediated conditional mutant mice  selectively lacking the alpha1 subunit (forebrain-specific alpha1(-/-)) or expressing either a single wild-type (H) or a single point-mutated (R) alpha1 allele (forebrain-specific alpha1(-/H) and alpha1(-/R) mice  respectively) in forebrain glutamatergic neurons. In the rest of the brain  alpha1(-/R) mutants are heterozygous alpha1(H101R) mice. Forebrain-specific alpha1(-/-) mice showed enhanced diazepam-induced motor depression and increased expression of the alpha2 and alpha3 subunits in the neocortex and hippocampus  in comparison with their pseudo-wild-type littermates. Forebrain-specific alpha1(-/R) mice were less sensitive than alpha1(-/H) mice to the motor-depressing action of diazepam  but each of these conditional mutants had a similar behavioral response as their corresponding control littermates. Unexpectedly  expression of the alpha1 subunit was reduced in forebrain  notably in alpha1(-/R) mice  and the alpha3 subunit was up-regulated in neocortex  indicating that proper alpha1 subunit expression requires both alleles. In conclusion  conditional manipulation of GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit expression can induce compensatory changes in the affected areas. Specifically  alterations in GABA(A) receptor expression restricted to forebrain glutamatergic neurons reproduce the behavioral effects seen after a global alteration  thereby implicating these neurons in the motor-sedative effect of diazepam."

The sustained exposure to these three BZDs increased [(45)Ca2+] influx  which was due to the enhanced [(45)Ca2+] entry through L-type HVCCs but not through of Cav2.1 and Cav2.2. Increase in [(3)H]diltiazem binding after the exposure to these three BZDs was due to the increase in the binding sites of [(3)H]diltiazem. Western blot analysis showed increase of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 in association with the increased expression of alpha2/delta1 subunit. Similar changes in [(3)H]diltiazem binding and L-type HVCC subunit expression were found in the cerebral cortex from mouse with BZD physical dependence. These results indicate that BZDs examined here have the potential to increase L-type HVCC functions mediated via the enhanced expression of not only Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 but also alpha2/delta1 subunit after their sustained exposure  which may participate in the development of physical dependence by these BZDs."
"462","17938891","Behavioral and brain temperature responses to salient environmental stimuli and intravenous cocaine in rats: effects of diazepam.","RATIONALE: While diazepam is an effective anxiolytic and somnolent drug in humans  its physiological and behavioral effects in animals are often variable. Differences in basal activity state (basal arousal) may be important in determining both this response variability and the pattern of drug influence on behavioral and physiological responses to natural arousing stimuli and other drugs.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the changes in brain  muscle  and skin temperatures  and in locomotion induced in rats by several arousing stimuli and intravenous (i.v.) cocaine; and to assess how these responses are modulated by diazepam at a relatively low dose (1 mg/kg  i.p.).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male rats were implanted with thermal probes in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc)  temporal muscle  and subcutaneously  and equipped with a chronic i.v. catheter. They were exposed to 1-min tail-pinch  1-min social interaction with another male and cocaine (1 mg/kg  i.v.) after administration of diazepam or saline.RESULTS: While the injection of either diazepam or saline resulted in similar locomotor activation and temperature responses  diazepam decreased basal brain and muscle temperatures for about 3 h; the temperature-decreasing effect of diazepam was oppositely related to basal brain temperature (r = -0.51). After diazepam  rats also showed weaker temperature and locomotor responses to both arousing stimuli; the effect was stronger for tail-pinch and for absolute temperature increases than relative changes. Although diazepam significantly decreased cocaine-induced locomotor activation  it had virtually no effects on cocaine-induced temperature responses in all locations.CONCLUSIONS: In accordance with the &quot;law of initial values&quot;  the temperature-increasing effects of all tested arousing stimuli and temperature-decreasing effect of diazepam depend upon basal brain temperature. The greatest temperature effects are seen with arousing stimuli at low basal arousal (increases) and with diazepam at high basal arousal (decreases). This is a likely explanation for the variability seen with the physiological and behavioral effects of diazepam in animals."

Although endozepines have been localized and characterized in the trout hypothalamus  so far  the action of these neuropeptides on feeding behavior has never been investigated in fish. In the present study  we have examined the effect of i.c.v. administration of synthetic rat ODN  its C-terminal octapeptide (OP) and the head-to-tail cyclic analog cyclo(1-8)OP (cOP) on feeding behavior in the goldfish model. i.c.v. injection of graded doses of ODN (2.5-10 pmol/g body weight (BW)) induced a dose-dependent inhibition of food intake  a significant decrease in cumulative food intake during the 60-min period after feeding being observed at doses of 5 and 10 pmol/g BW. The inhibitory effect of a 10 pmol/g BW dose of ODN on food consumption (-39%) was mimicked by an equimolar dose of OP (-42%) and cOP (-53%). The food intake-suppressing activity of ODN (10 pmol/g BW) was not affected by pre-injection of the CBR antagonist flumazenil (200 pmol/g BW). In contrast  the anorexigenic effect of ODN (10 pmol/g BW) was totally suppressed by a selective antagonist of metabotropic endozepine receptors  cyclo(1-8)[dLeu(5)]OP. These data indicate that  in goldfish as in rodents  ODN is a potent inhibitor of food consumption  and that the anorexigenic effect of ODN is not mediated through CBR but through the metabotropic endozepine receptor."

Twenty-two of the 24 rats developed SE and 2 of them died. The surviving 20 rats were then randomly divided into 2 equal groups: olomoucine group  injected intracerebroventricularly after the SE was terminated by diazepam and chloral hydrate once a day for 3 days  and SE group  infused intracerebroventricularly with DMSO solution Another 10 rats were injected intraperitoneally with normal saline and then infused intracerebroventricularly with DMSO solution to be used as control group. Six hours after SE attack 5 rats from each group were killed respectively with their brains taken out. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines  such as interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Three days later the other 5 rats in each group were killed with their entorhinal cortex and hippocampus taken out. TUNEL was used to observe the apoptosis. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to detect the expression of neuronal nuclear nucleoprotein (NeuN) and cyclin B1.RESULTS: TUNEL showed that apoptotic neurons were rare in the control group and were numerous in the SE group  especially in the entorhinal cortex and the hylus of dentate gyrus  and the number of apoptotic neurons in the hylus of dentate gyrus of the olomoucine group was not significantly different from that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05)  however  the number of apoptotic cells in the entorhinal cortex of the olomoucine group was still significantly higher than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05). IF staining demonstrated that in the control group the co-expression of NeuN and TUNEL-labeled cells was weak; and in the SE group the co-expression of NeuN and TUNEL was significantly increased compared with that in the control group (P &lt; 0. 05). The number of cyclin B1 positive cells in the olomoucine group was 18.22 +/- 3.99  significantly lower than that of the SE group (24.57 +/- 6.78  P &lt; 0.05). Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that the IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA expression levels of the SE group were both significantly higher than those of the control group (both P &lt; 0.05)  and the IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA expression levels of the olomoucine group  except the TNF-alpha mRNA expression in the cortex  were all significantly lower than those of the SE group (all P &lt; 0.05)  and not significantly different from those of the control group (all P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: Olomoucine treatment can inhibits cell cycle protein B1 expression  anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and TNF-alpha secretion  thus decreasing neuronal death and providing neuroprotection after SE  which suggests a potential promising therapeutic way for epilepsy treatment."

Autonomic functions such as the temperature and the heart rate were recorded by telemetry. The action on the HPA axis was assessed via measurements of the plasma corticosterone and ACTH levels. To reveal the transmission of the endocrine responses  animals were pretreated with corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor (CRHR) antagonists (1 nmol). In the open field test  the animals were pretreated with either a CRHR(1) antagonist (antalarmin) or haloperidol (10 microg/kg)  while in the EPM test they were pretreated with antalarmin or diazepam (1 mg/kg). The dopamine release from striatal and amygdala slices after peptide treatment was measured with a superfusion apparatus. Neuromedin S exerted dose-dependent effects on the HPA system  which were inhibited by antalarmin. It also activated grooming and decreased the entries to and time spent in the open arms during the EPM test. The grooming response was abolished by haloperidol and antalarmin pretreatment  while diazepam and antalarmin showed a tendency to attenuate the response evoked in the EPM test. In the superfusion studies  neuromedin S enhanced the dopamine release from the amygdala slices. These results demonstrate that neuromedin S stimulates the HPA axis through the CRHR(1) pathway and evokes stereotyped behavior and anxiety through mesolimbic dopamine and corticotrophin releasing hormone release."

The 3 groups in Set 2 were further divided into 2 equal subgroups of 10 rats to be killed 6 or 24 h after SE.RESULTS: The mdr1a expression in hippocampus within 72 h after seizure was much higher at each time point: the level of mdr1a expression instantly after the seizure was terminated was [5.6 (2.9) x 10(5) mRNA copies/40 ng total RNA]  significantly higher than that of the controls [2.4 (1.1) x 10(5) mRNA copies/40 ng total RNA  P &lt; 0.05]  increased to the level of [7.6 (6.3) x 10(5)  P &lt; 0.01] 3 h after  and kept at such level till 72 h after. The msr1b expression transiently increased 2.2 and 2.4 times that of the controls respectively 3 h and 6 h after the seizure was terminated [(3.3 +/- 0.4) x 10(4)  and (3.6 +/- 1.0) x 10(4)  both P &lt; 0.01)]. The expression level of mdr1a 6 h after the seizure was terminated of the MK801 group was (4.3 +/- 0.8) x 10(5) and the expression level of mdr1b 6 h after the seizure was terminated of the MK801 group was (2.0 +/- 0.7) x 10(4)  both significantly lower than those of the SE group (both P &lt; 0.01). The P-gp expression level 24 h after the seizure was terminated of the MK801 group was 26.6 +/- 5.0 pieces of microvessels/400 times field  significantly lower than that of the SE group (39.0 +/- 4.1  P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: MK801 down-regulates the overexpression of P-gp after seizure  which indicates that NMDA receptor may be involved in the regulation of P-gp expression during seizure. Therefore  it is possible to prevent the overexpression of P-gp after seizure by inhibiting NMDA receptor's overactivation effectively."

Diazepam and imipramine were used as reference drugs. SB-258585 at a dose of 1 microg (but not 0.3 and 3 microg) showed an anticonflict effect that was weaker than that of diazepam (40 microg). SB-258585 at a dose of 3 microg (but not 1 and 10 microg) produced a marked anti-immobility effect comparable with that of imipramine (0.1 microg). The anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like activity of SB-258585 seemed to be specific  as that compound--when given by the same route in doses effective in each model--did not affect the shock threshold  nonpunished water consumption  or exploratory activity of rats. The results obtained indicate that the hippocampus is one of the neuroanatomical sites involved in the anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like activity of the selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB-258585."

Lindane  an organochlorine pesticide has been shown to adversely affect memory and induce oxidative stress on both acute and chronic exposure. The present study was designed to explore the modulation of effects of lindane over cognitive function by progesterone (PROG)  pregnenolone sulfate (PREG-S) and 4'-chlorodiazepam (4CD). Cognitive function was assessed using step-down latency (SDL) on a passive avoidance apparatus and transfer latency (TL) on a plus maze. Oxidative stress was assessed by examining brain malondialdehyde (MDA) and non-protein thiol (NP-SH) levels. A significant reduction in SDL was found for the lindane treated group at weeks 6 and 7 as compared to control (p&lt;0.001). One-week treatment by PREG-S or 4CD antagonized the effect of lindane on SDL. PROG failed to modulate the effect of lindane on SDL. Lindane caused a significant prolongation of TL as compared to control (p&lt;0.001) from second week onwards. One-week administration of PROG  PREG-S or 4CD was unable to reverse this prolongation of TL. Lindane produced a statistically significant increase in the brain MDA levels (p&lt;0.001) and significant decrease in the brain NP-SH levels (p&lt;0.001). Treatment with PREG-S and 4CD attenuated the effect of lindane on MDA (p&lt;0.001) and NP-SH levels. PROG failed to influence oxidative stress induced by lindane. Results of the present study thus show that some NS have potential in reversing cognitive dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by toxicants like lindane in the brain."

The anxiolytic-like effects of obovatol in mice were examined using the elevated plus-maze and the automatic hole-board apparatus. Oral administration of obovatol (0.2  0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of open arm entries and the spent time on open arm in the elevated plus-maze test  compared with those of saline. Obovatol (0.2  0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) also produced anxiolytic-like effects  as reflected by an increase in head-dipping behaviors. These effects were comparable to those of diazepam (1.0 mg/kg)  a well known anxiolytic drug. On the other hand  the anxiolytic-like effects of obovatol and diazepam were reversed by flumazenil  a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist  suggesting that the anxiolytic-like effects of obovatol were involved in GABA-benzodiazepine receptors complex. Obovatol was muscle relaxant by rota-rod test  but its effect was weaker than diazepam. Spontaneous locomotor activity also was inhibited by obovatol. Obovatol selectively increased the GABA(A) receptors alpha(1) subunit expression in amygdala of mouse brain. Obovatol also showed to bind to benzodiazepine receptors competitively in experiments using [(3)H]flunitrazepam in the cerebral cortex of mouse brain. Moreover  obovatol (10  20 and 50 microM) increased Cl(-) influx and the increased Cl(-) influx was inhibited by flumazenil  in primary cultured neuronal cells and IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells. These results suggest that obovatol has anxiolytic-like effects  and these pharmacological effects may be mediated by GABA-benzodiazepine receptors-activated Cl(-) channel opening."

However  there are no studies in vivo demonstrating the potential injurious effect of lidocaine on the central nervous system. Therefore  the aim of our study was to investigate if lidocaine is involved in neuronal damage in the CA3 hippocampus and amygdala regions when using a single subconvulsive or a convulsive lidocaine dose. Two-month-old male Wistar rats (57) were used. The animals were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group I received 0.9% saline ip (n=9)  group II received a single lidocaine dose of 60 mg/kg (n=18)  and group III received 90 mg/kg ip (n=12). At day 2  7  and 10 after the dosing  three to six rats per group were sacrificed. The brains of the rats were removed and were embedded in paraffin. Coronal cuts of 7 microm were made. Each brain section was stained with cresyl-eosin. We evaluated the number of normal and abnormal neurons in the hippocampal CA3 (pyramidal) and basolateral amygdala (large and medium neurons) regions in a 10 000 microm2 section. To explore an association between lidocaine-induced seizure and neuronal damage  diazepam was used (10 mg/kg ig) as an anticonvulsant two hours before a 90 mg/kg dose of lidocaine. Lidocaine causes a morphological neuronal alteration in the CA3 hippocampal region and the basolateral amygdala and possibly an inhibition-excitation imbalance. Diazepam prevents lidocaine-induced seizures  but not neuronal damage in brain structures. Interaction of lidocaine with the membrane components produces disrupted Ca+2 homeostasis and causes neuronal damage. Moreover  it is possible that lidocaine or its metabolites could actively participate in the neuronal damage observed."
"474","17685016","[The effect of atropine and diazepam on mammalian neuromuscular junction--a model of their protective action against anticholinesterase-based war and agriculture poisons].","The effect of atropine and diazepam on the mammalian neuromuscular junction. Nicotinolytic effect of atropine on the neuromuscular junction is discussed as a main mechanism of the beneficial effect of this drug during war and agriculture poisoning by anticholinesterases. Atropine is beneficial as it reduces the amplitude of intracellularly recorded endplate potentials and  first of all  causes a marked shortening of their time course (Beránek  Vyskocil 1968  Magazanik  Vyskocil 1969). Diazepam effectively blocks trains of action potentials in individual rat diaphragm muscle fibers  apparently by elevating the chloride permeability. It is suggested that similar increase in Cl- permeability may occur in brain excitable structures and can counteract the anticholinesterase-induced prolongation of ACh-depolarization that evokes repetitive firing."
"475","17680198","Central neurogenic hyperventilation treated with intravenous fentanyl followed by transdermal application.","Central neurogenic hyperventilation (CNH) is a rare clinical condition that is sometimes difficult to treat. We report a 51-year-old female patient who was successfully treated with intravenous fentanyl followed by transdermal fentanyl. She had a transient epileptic episode with a temporary loss of consciousness. Immediately before her admission to the intensive care unit (ICU)  her Pa(CO2) and pH were 6.7 mmHg and 7.64  respectively. Rebreathing from a paper bag and the intravenous administration of diazepam failed to improve the decreased Pa(CO2). Therefore  we administered intravenous fentanyl  at the rate of 50 microg x h(-1). Two days after her admission to the ICU  the Pa(CO2) had increased gradually to 22.9 mmHg  and the pH to 7.50. Although infiltration of recurrent lymphoma to the brain became apparent  she remained active  without epilepsy or loss of consciousness  in a general ward for 1 month with transdermal fentanyl  treatment until she again became drowsy; she died on hospital day 58. Transdermal fentanyl seems to be a good palliative measure to treat CNH in patients who have advanced neoplasms."
"476","17669374","Brainstem areas activated by diazepam withdrawal as measured by Fos-protein immunoreactivity in rats.","In the 1970s  chronic treatment with benzodiazepines was supposed not to cause dependence. However  by the end of the decade several reports showed that the interruption of a prolonged treatment with diazepam leads to a withdrawal syndrome characterized  among other symptoms  by an exaggerated level of anxiety. In laboratory animals  signs that oscillate from irritability to extreme fear-like behaviors and convulsions have also been reported. In recent years many studies have attempted to disclose the neural substrates responsible for the benzodiazepines withdrawal. However  they have focused on telencephalic structures such as the prefrontal cortex  nucleus accumbens and amygdala. In this study  we examined the Fos immunoreactivity in brain structures known to be implicated in the neural substrates of aversion in rats under spontaneous diazepam-withdrawal. We found that the same group of structures that originally modulate the defensive responses evoked by fear stimuli  including the dorso-medial hypothalamus  the superior and inferior colliculus and the dorsal periaqueductal gray  were most labeled following diazepam withdrawal. It is suggested that an enhanced neural activation of neural substrates of fear in the midbrain tectum may underlie the aversive state elicited in diazepam-withdrawn rats."

Furthermore  we investigated whether low concentrations of ethanol affect the delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor assemblies in the rat brain using radioligand binding to the rat brain membrane homogenates as well as to the immunoprecipitated receptor assemblies. Our results revealed that delta subunit is not co-localized with gamma(2) subunit but it is associated with the alpha(1)  alpha(4) or alpha(6)  beta(2) and/or beta(3) subunit(s) of GABA(A) receptors in the rat brain. Ethanol (1-50 mM) neither affected [(3)H]muscimol (3 nM) binding nor diazepam-insensitive [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 (2 nM) binding in the rat cerebellum and cerebral cortex membranes. However  a higher concentration of ethanol (500 mM) inhibited the binding of these radioligands to the GABA(A) receptors partially in the rat cerebellum and cerebral cortex. Similarly  ethanol (up to 50 mM) did not affect [(3)H]muscimol (15 nM) binding to the immunoprecipitated delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor assemblies in the rat cerebellum and hippocampus but it inhibited the binding partially at a higher concentration (500 mM). These results suggest that the native delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors do not play a major role in the pharmacology of clinically relevant low concentrations of ethanol."
"478","17638297","Increase in diazepam binding inhibitor expression by sustained morphine exposure is mediated via mu-opioid receptors in primary cultures of mouse cerebral cortical neurons.","Our previous in vivo experiment demonstrates that chronic morphine treatment up-regulates diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) transcripts in mouse cerebral cortex  although detailed mechanisms were unclear (Katsura et al. [1998] J. Neurochem. 71:2638-2641). This study sought to elucidate the precise mechanisms of DBI mRNA up-regulation by long-term treatment with morphine using primary cultures of mouse cerebral cortical neurons. A significant increase in DBI mRNA was observed after sustained exposure to 0.3 microM morphine for 2 days  and the maximal expression occurred after 2 days of exposure  whereas transient exposure to 0.3 microM morphine for 15 min  1 hr  and 3 hr produced no changes in the expression. Continuous exposure to DAMGO also significantly increased DBI mRNA expression  which was completely abolished by a selective antagonist of mu-opioid receptors  beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA). The morphine-induced increase in DBI mRNA expression and its content were completely inhibited by naloxone and beta-FNA  and the inhibitory potential of naloxonazine was about half that of beta-FNA. On the other hand  kappa- and delta-opioid receptor antagonists showed no effects on the morphine-induced increase in DBI mRNA. In addition  both a calmodulin antagonist and a CaM II kinase inhibitor significantly suppressed the morphine-induced increase in DBI mRNA. These results indicate that the increase in DBI expression is induced by continuous activation of mu-opioid receptors but not of kappa- and delta-opioid receptors and is regulated by the calcium/calmodulin-related phosphorylation system."
"479","17629403","Effects of GABAergic inhibition on neocortical long-term potentiation in the chronically prepared rat.","Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a form of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity that is a candidate cellular mechanism for some forms of learning and memory. Although GABAergic synaptic inhibition plays a critical role in regulating of synaptic plasticity  there is still little known about the GABAergic modulation on LTP induction in chronic preparation. In the present study we examined the effect of GABA(A) agonist  diazepam (DZM)  and antagonist  picrotoxin (PTX) on the induction of LTP in the somatosensory cortex of freely moving rats for a long-term period. In adult rats a bipolar stimulating and recording electrode were implanted into corpus callusom and somatosensory cortex  respectively. Two weeks after the surgery  evoked field potential responses were recorded before  during (12 days)  and after (1 month) induction period of LTP by high-frequency stimulation. The LTP characteristics were compared between control  DZM and PTX groups during the time course of recording in each rat. Administration of DZM prior to train  blocked the induction of neocortical LTP  while the PTX increased the development of LTP making the highest differential levels of LTP about 12 days after the initiation of LTP induction. Our findings suggest that the augmentation of LTP by PTX can be explained by an interaction between excitatory and inhibitory pathways. Suppression of neocortical inhibitory inputs by PTX causes enhancement in LTP induction. These results suggest that GABAergic system has an important role in synaptic plasticity and long-term modification of somatosensory cortex in freely moving rat."

The compound was shown to have a broad cytotoxic activity in the low micromolar range when tested in the NCI 60 cell line panel. In the work presented here  ECO-4601 was further evaluated against brain tumor cell lines. Preliminary mechanistic studies as well as in vivo antitumor evaluation were performed.METHODS: Since ECO-4601 has a benzodiazepinone moiety  we first investigated if it binds the central and/or peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. ECO-4601 was tested in radioligand binding assays on benzodiazepine receptors obtained from rat hearts. The ability of ECO-4601 to inhibit the growth of CNS cancers was evaluated on a panel of mouse  rat and human glioma cell lines using a standard MTT assay. Antitumor efficacy studies were performed on gliomas (rat and human)  human breast and human prostate mouse tumor xenografts. Antitumor activity and pharmacokinetic analysis of ECO-4601 was evaluated following intravenous (i.v.)  subcutaneous (s.c.)  and intraperitoneal (i.p.) bolus administrations.RESULTS: ECO-4601 was shown to bind the peripheral but not the central benzodiazepine receptor and inhibited the growth of CNS tumor cell lines. Bolus s.c. and i.p. administration gave rise to low but sustained drug exposure  and resulted in moderate to significant antitumor activity at doses that were well tolerated. In a rat glioma (C6) xenograft model  ECO-4601 produced up to 70% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) while in a human glioma (U-87MG) xenograft  TGI was 34%. Antitumor activity was highly significant in both human hormone-independent breast (MDA-MB-231) and prostate (PC-3) xenografts  resulting in TGI of 72 and 100%  respectively. On the other hand  i.v. dosing was followed by rapid elimination of the drug and was ineffective.CONCLUSIONS: Antitumor efficacy of ECO-4601 appears to be associated with the exposure parameter AUC and/or sustained drug levels rather than C (max). These in vivo data constitute a rationale for clinical studies testing prolonged continuous administration of ECO-4601."

Five days after the induction of SE  the rats were injected with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine-5-monophosphate (BrdU; 75 mg/kg  i.p.)  a marker of cell division. One day after the BrdU injection  the numbers of BrdU-labeled cells in the supra- and infrapyramidal blades were significantly higher in the KA-injected rats compared to the saline-injected rats. In the saline-injected rats  the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the infrapyramidal blade was greater than in the suprapyramidal blade. Twenty-eight days after the BrdU injection  the number of BrdU-labeled cells remained significantly higher in the KA-injected rats than the saline-injected rats  but only in the infrapyramidal blade. In addition  when the extent of cell death was examined with Fluoro-Jade B (a marker of dead and dying cells) 3 days after the induction of SE  degenerating cells were more numerous in the infrapyramidal blade than in the suprapyramidal blade. Our results suggest that there is an asymmetry of neurogenesis and cell death in the rostral dentate gyrus of rats following KA-induced SE."

The general cytotoxicity  determined as the total cellular protein levels after the 72 hours exposure period  was used for comparison to the specific endpoints and for estimation of acute lethality. The lowest concentration that induced 20% effect (EC20) obtained for each compound  was used as a surrogate for the lowest neurotoxic level (LOEL) at the target site in vivo. The LOELs were integrated with data on adsorption  distribution  metabolism and excretion of the compounds in physiologically-based biokinetic (PBBK) models of the rat and the lowest observed effective doses (LOEDs) were estimated for the test compounds. A good correlation was observed between the estimated LOEDs and experimental LOEDs found in literature for rat for all test compounds  except for diazepam. However  when using in vitro data from the literature on diazepam's effect on gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)A receptor function for the estimation of LOED  the correlation between the estimated and experimental LOEDs was improved from a 10 000-fold to a 10-fold difference.

By itself  BPA concentration-dependently elicited the membrane current  which was significantly blocked by bicuculline  a selective GABA(A) receptor antagonist. BPA potentiated the peak I(GABA) induced by lower concentrations of GABA (&lt;10 microM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The extent of BPA-induced potentiation of I(GABA) was significantly reduced by either diazepam or ethanol  allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors. BPA  however  inhibited the peak I(GABA) induced by higher concentrations of GABA (&gt;30 microM)  and accelerated the desensitization rate of I(GABA). BPA also greatly inhibited the steady state I(GABA) induced by higher concentrations of GABA (&gt;30 microM) in a noncompetitive manner. In addition  BPA affected synaptic GABA(A) receptors as it decreased the amplitude of GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in a concentration-dependent manner.

Pharmacokinetic variables did not differ significantly between the two age groups. DZP at 10 mg in young subjects induced significant increases in both the CRT and SSS score. DZP at 5 mg induced no significant increase in SSS score in either age group but did induce a significant increase in CRT only in the older subjects that matched that in young subjects given 10 mg DZP. The older subjects suffered from dissociation between subjective sleepiness and objective psychomotor impairment under DZP treatment. Such individuals may underestimate the detrimental effects on brain function."

In this study  the effects of five members of the fenamate NSAID group were investigated on native ligand-gated ion channels expressed in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. All fenamates tested (1-100 microM) dose-dependently potentiated GABA-evoked currents; mefenamic acid (MFA) was the most potent and efficacious and was found to shift the GABA dose-response curve to the left without effect on the maximum amplitude or the GABA Hill Slope. The modulation of GABA receptors by MFA was not reduced in the presence of the benzodiazepine antagonist  flumazenil (10 microM) and was moderately voltage-dependent. MFA at concentrations &gt;or=10 microM evoked dose-dependent currents in the absence of GABA. These currents were potentiated by diazepam (1 microM) and blocked by bicuculline (10 microM). The MFA (50 microM) current-voltage relationship and reversal potential were similar to that evoked by GABA. MFA (1-100 microM) had no effects on sub-maximal glycine  glutamate or NMDA evoked currents. These data show that fenamate NSAIDs are a highly effective class of GABA(A) receptor modulator and activators."

Systemic administration of levetiracetam (2.5-30 mg/kg  intraperitoneally (i.p.)) was able to produce a dose-dependent decrease in DBA/2 audiogenic seizure severity score. In combination with conventional antiepileptic drugs  levetiracetam  5mg/kg  i.p.  which per se did not significantly affect the occurrence of audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice  potentiated the anticonvulsant activity of some antiepileptic drugs studied against sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice. The degree of potentiation induced by levetiracetam was greater  approximately twice  for carbamazepine  diazepam  felbamate  topiramate  gabapentin  and valproate  less for lamotrigine  phenobarbital and phenytoin. This increase was associated with a comparable impairment in motor activity; however  the therapeutic index of combined treatment of antiepileptic drugs with levetiracetam was more favourable than the combination with saline with the exception of lamotrigine  phenytoin and phenobarbital. Since levetiracetam did not significantly influence the total and free plasma and the brain levels of antiepileptics studied. In addition  levetiracetam did not significantly affect the hypothermic effects of the anticonvulsants tested. In conclusion  levetiracetam showed an additive anticonvulsant effect when administered in combination with some classical anticonvulsants  most notably carbamazepine  diazepam  felbamate  gabapentin  topiramate and valproate  implicating a possible therapeutic relevance of such drug combinations."

The pathophysiology of this disabling and commonly irreversible movement disorder continues obscure and may be caused due to GABAergic hypofunction or increased oxidative damage and free radical generation. Chronic treatment with typical antipsychotics leads to the development of abnormal hyperkinetic orofacial movements (vacuous chewing movements  tongue protrusions and facial jerking) in rats and is widely accepted as the animal model for tardive dyskinesia. Zolpidem  a GABA-mimetic drug is structurally related to melatonin and has been reported to possess anti-oxidant and neuroprotective effects both in vivo and in vitro. The study was carried out to investigate whether zolpidem can be used in the treatment of typical anti-psychotic-induced orofacial dyskinesia. Chronic haloperidol (1 mg/kg  i.p. for 21 days) and chlorpromazine (5 mg/kg  i.p. for 21 days) treatment significantly induced orofacial hyperkinetic movements and zolpidem [N  N  6-trimethyl-2-p-tolyl-imidazo (1  2-a) pyridine 3-acetamideL-(+)] dose dependently (1  2  5 mg/kg i.p. for 21 days) reduced these haloperidol and chlorpromazine-induced hyperkinetic orofacial movements. Biochemical analysis revealed that haloperidol and chlorpromazine treatment significantly induced increase in lipid peroxidation and decrease in the levels of total nitric oxide levels  non-protein thiols (NPSH) and of anti-oxidant defense enzymes  superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase in the striatum of rat brain. Co-administration of zolpidem (1  2  5 mg/kg i.p. for 21 days) significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and restored the non-protein thiols and total nitric oxide levels induced by chronic haloperidol and chlorpromazine treatment. It also significantly reversed the haloperidol and chlorpromazine-induced decrease in brain SOD and catalase activity. Neurochemical analysis (Neurotransmitter and their metabolite level estimation) revealed that haloperidol and chlorpromazine significantly decreased the dopamine  norepinephrine and serotonin levels in brain homogenates where as it caused a significant increase in the metabolite (VMA and HVA) levels in urine  which were significantly reversed by zolpidem at higher doses.

"489","17455193","Loss of input from the mossy cells blocks maturation of newly generated granule cells.","The objective of this work is to check whether the input from the mossy cells to the inner molecular layer is necessary for the integration and maturation of the newly generated granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) in mice  and if after status epilepticus the sprouting of the mossy fibers can substitute for this projection. Newly generated cells were labeled by administration of 5-bromo-deoxyuridine either before or after pilocarpine administration. The neuronal loss in the hippocampus after administration of pilocarpine combined with scopolamine and diazepam seemed restricted to the hilar mossy cells. The maturation of the granule cells was studied using immunohistochemistry for calretinin and NeuN in combination with detection of 5-bromo-deoxyuridine. The sprouting of the mossy fibers was detected using Timm staining for zinc-rich boutons. In normal conditions  granule cells took about 2 weeks to lose the immature marker calretinin. After the loss of the mossy cells  newly generated granule cells remained expressing calretinin for more than a month  until the sprouting of the mossy fibers substituted for the projection of the mossy cells in the inner molecular layer of the DG. Therefore  a proper pattern of connectivity is necessary for the normal development and integration of newly generated granule cells in the adult brain. In a changed environment they cannot adapt transforming in other cell types; simply they are unable to mature. The sprouting of the mossy fibers  although aberrant and a probable source of epileptic activity  may be important for the correct physiology of the granule cells  restoring a likeness of normality in their connective environment. The survival of granule cells incorporated as mature neurons was increased after pilocarpine when compared with normal conditions. Thus  it is likely that the reorganization of the circuitry after the loss of the mossy cells facilitates the survival and incorporation of the newly generated granule cells."

Our results show that basal levels of hippocampal [(3)H]MK-801 ((1)-5-methyl-10 11-dihydro-5Hdibenzo[a d]cyclohepten-5 10-imine) binding sites were decreased in CB1-/- mice and that these mice were also less sensitive to the locomotor effects of MK-801. Basal level of both hippocampal and cerebellar [(3)H]muscimol binding was lower and sensitivity to the hypothermic effects of diazepam and pentobarbital was increased in CB1-/- mice. GABA(A)alpha1  beta2  and gamma2 and NMDA receptor (NR) 1 and 2B subunit mRNA levels were altered in striatum of CB1-/- mice. Our results also showed that [(3)H]MK-801 binding sites were increased in cerebral cortex and hippocampus after chronic ethanol ingestion only in wild-type mice. Chronic ethanol ingestion did not modify the sensitivity to the locomotor effects of MK-801 in both genotypes. Similarly  chronic ethanol ingestion reduced the number of [(3)H]muscimol binding sites in cerebral cortex  but not in cerebellum  only in CB1+/+ mice. We conclude that lifelong deletion of CB1 receptors impairs neuroadaptations of both NMDA and GABA(A) receptors after chronic ethanol exposure and that the endocannabinoid/CB1 receptor system is involved in alcohol dependence."
"491","17394545","Antipsychotic drugs reverse the AMPA receptor-stimulated release of 5-HT in the medial prefrontal cortex.","The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. PFC neuronal activity is modulated by monoaminergic receptors for which antipsychotic drugs display moderate-high affinity  such as 5-HT(2A) and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Conversely  PFC pyramidal neurons project to and modulate the activity of raphe serotonergic neurons and serotonin (5-HT) release. Under the working hypothesis that atypical antipsychotic drugs may partly exert their action in PFC  we assessed their action on the in vivo 5-HT release evoked by increasing glutamatergic transmission in rat medial PFC (mPFC). This was achieved by applying S-AMPA in mPFC (reverse dialysis) or by disinhibiting thalamic excitatory afferents to mPFC with bicuculline. The application of haloperidol  chlorpromazine  clozapine and olanzapine in mPFC by reverse dialysis (but not reboxetine or diazepam) reversed the S-AMPA-evoked local 5-HT release. Likewise  the local (in mPFC) or systemic administration of these antipsychotic drugs reversed the increased prefrontal 5-HT release produced by thalamic disinhibition. These effects were shared by the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist M100907 and the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. However  raclopride (DA D2 antagonist) had very modest effects. These results suggest that  besides their action in limbic striatum  antipsychotic drugs may attenuate glutamatergic transmission in PFC  possibly by interacting with 5-HT(2A) and/or alpha(1)-adrenoceptors."

Monoamine release and turnover were assessed using microdialysis and ex vivo tissue levels.RESULTS: LY404039 attenuated amphetamine- and phencyclidine-induced hyperlocomotion (3-30 and 10 mg/kg  respectively). LY404039 (3-10 mg/kg) inhibited conditioned avoidance responding. LY404039 also reduced fear-potentiated startle in rats (3-30 microg/kg) and marble burying in mice (3-10 mg/kg)  indicating anxiolytic-like effects. Importantly  LY404039 did not produce sedative effects or motor impairment as measured by rotarod performance and lack of escape failures in the conditioned avoidance task (at doses up to 30 and 10 mg/kg  respectively). LY404039 (10 mg/kg) also increased dopamine and serotonin release/turnover in the prefrontal cortex.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the broad preclinical efficacy of LY404039 across multiple animal models of antipsychotic and anxiolytic efficacy. Additionally  this compound modulates mesocortical neurotransmission and provides a novel mechanism for the treatment of psychiatric disorders that may be associated with improved efficacy and reduced incidence of undesirable side effects. As glutamatergic dysfunction has been linked to the etiology of schizophrenia  clinical studies with more potent mGlu2/3 agonists  such as LY404039  may be useful to explore the validity of this hypothesis."
"493","17362277","First-line therapy for theophylline-associated seizures.","Theophylline-associated seizures (TAS) are considered a neurologic emergency  as they can sometimes be intractable and difficult to stop with standard treatments such as intravenous administration of diazepam. As a consequence  a proportion of patients who experience status epilepticus while receiving theophylline will require endotracheal intubation. The optimal first-line therapy for TAS has not yet been fully investigated. We compared 54 cases of TAS with 779 cases of non-TAS  that had presented at a single institution between 1991 and 2002. Among the 54 cases of TAS  36 experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures  with the remainder experiencing partial seizures. TAS occurred mainly in children under 3 years of age  and serum theophylline levels were within the therapeutic range in 78% of the cases. The duration of TAS tended to be longer than for non-TAS  and intravenous administration of diazepam was less effective in controlling TAS (45%)  compared with non-TAS (68%). Many cases required repeated injections of diazepam  and 15 cases (27%) eventually required endotracheal intubation. Reports concerning the therapy for TAS were also reviewed. Theophylline is known to antagonize the effects of benzodiazepines  and this may explain why drugs such as diazepam are relatively ineffective in treating TAS. In TAS  the prompt use of barbiturates is recommended when diazepam is not effective  to avoid potential brain injury secondary to status epilepticus."

The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Anwala churna (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.)  an Ayurvedic preparation on memory  total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice. Anwala churna was administered orally in three doses (50  100 and 200 mg/kg) for fifteen days to different groups of young and aged mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam-  scopolamine- and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. Total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity also estimated. Anwala churna (50  100 and 200 mg/kg  p.o.) produced a dose-dependent improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. Furthermore  it reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg  i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg  i.p.). Interestingly  brain cholinesterase activity and total cholesterol levels were reduced by Anwala churna administered orally for 15 days. Anwala churna may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of Alzheimer's disease on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as  memory improving property  cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity."

We developed a humanized dynamic in vitro BBB model (DIV-BBB) based on cocultures of human microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) from &quot;normal&quot; and drug-resistant epileptic brain tissue with human brain astrocytes (HAs) from epilepsy patients or controls.METHODS: HBMECs and HAs were cocultured for 28 days in polypropylene capillaries. HBMECs were exposed to physiologic levels of shear stress generated by intraluminal flow. Permeability to [3H]sucrose  [14C]phenytoin  and [14C]diazepam was measured in control and drug-resistant DIV-BBB with and without pretreatment with the MDR1 inhibitor XR9576. BBB integrity was monitored by transendothelial electrical resistance measurements (TEERs). Cell growth and viability were assessed by measurement of glucose consumption and lactate production.RESULTS: PSucrose and TEER values did not depend on the origin of the endothelium used (epileptic or normal). PPhenytoin was 10-fold less (1.54 x 10(-6) cm/s) in drug-resistant BBB models than in controls (1.74 x 10(-5) cm/s). MDR1 blockade with XR9576 was effective (3.5-fold increase) only in drug-resistant cultures. PDiazepam in control and drug-resistant DIV-BBB was not affected by XR9576 and did not depend on the epileptic or control origin of endothelia. The overall contribution of epileptic glia to pharmacoresistance was negligible.CONCLUSIONS: These results show that  for the substances used  the humanized DIV-BBB recapitulates the physiologic permeability properties of the BBB in vivo and is also capable of mimicking a drug-resistant BBB phenotype."

In the Vogel conflict drinking test in rats  SB-399885 (1-3mg/kg i.p.) caused an anxiolytic-like activity comparable to that of diazepam (2.5-5mg/kg i.p.). An anxiolytic-like effect was also seen in the elevated plus-maze test in rats  where SB-399885 (0.3-3mg/kg i.p.) was slightly weaker than diazepam (2.5-5mg/kg i.p.). In the four-plate test in mice  SB-399885 (3-20mg/kg i.p.) showed an anxiolytic-like effect which was weaker than that produced by diazepam (2.5-5mg/kg i.p.). In the forced swim test in rats  SB-399885 (10mg/kg i.p.) significantly shortened the immobility time and the effect was stronger than that of imipramine (30mg/kg i.p.). In the forced swim test in mice  SB-399885 (20-30mg/kg i.p.) had an anti-immobility action  comparable to imipramine (30mg/kg i.p.) and also in the tail suspension test in mice  SB-399885 (10-30mg/kg i.p.) had an antidepressant-like effect  though was weaker than imipramine (10-20mg/kg i.p.).

Previous studies that used phospholipase C-related inactive protein type 1 knock-out (PRIP-1 KO) mice revealed that PRIP-1 is involved in the assembly and/or the trafficking of gamma2 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. There are two PRIP genes in mammals; thus the roles of PRIP-1 might be compensated partly by those of PRIP-2 in PRIP-1 KO mice. Here we used PRIP-1 and PRIP-2 double knock-out (PRIP-DKO) mice and examined the roles for PRIP in regulating the trafficking of GABA(A) receptors. Consistent with previous results  sensitivity to diazepam was reduced in electrophysiological and behavioral analyses of PRIP-DKO mice  suggesting an alteration of gamma2 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. The surface numbers of diazepam binding sites (alpha/gamma2 subunits) assessed by [3H]flumazenil binding were reduced in the PRIP-DKO mice as compared with those of wild-type mice  whereas the cell surface GABA binding sites (alpha/beta subunits  assessed by [3H]muscimol binding) were increased in PRIP-DKO mice. The association between GABA(A) receptors and GABA(A) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) was reduced significantly in PRIP-DKO neurons. Disruption of the direct interaction between PRIP and GABA(A) receptor beta subunits via the use of a peptide corresponding to the PRIP-1 binding site reduced the cell surface expression of gamma2 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors in cultured cell lines and neurons. These results suggest that PRIP is implicated in the trafficking of gamma2 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors to the cell surface  probably by acting as a bridging molecule between GABARAP and the receptors."

The age-dependent effects of [K(+)](o) on the reversal potential of the GABA(A)-mediated responses and membrane potential in hippocampal slices in vitro were compared with the effect of GABA(A)-receptors antagonists and GABA(A) modulators on high-potassium induced seizures in the CA3 pyramidal layer of rat hippocampus in vivo. GABA(A) responses were depolarizing at P8-12 and hyperpolarizing at P17-21. In P8-12 rats  GABA(A) responses switch their polarity from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing upon elevation of extracellular potassium. At approximately 10 mM [K(+)](o)  activation of GABA(A) receptors produced an isoelectric  purely shunting response characterized by no changes in the membrane potential but an increase in the membrane conductance. In P17-21 rats  the hyperpolarizing GABA(A) driving force progressively increased with elevation of [K(+)](o). In P8-12 rats in vivo  GABA(A)-receptor antagonists did not affect the occurrence of ictal discharges induced by intrahippocampal injection of 10 mM [K(+)](o)  but significantly increased seizure duration. Diazepam and isoguvacine completely prevented seizures induced by 10 mM [K(+)](o). In P17-21 rats  GABA(A)-receptor antagonists strongly increased the occurrence of ictal activity induced both by 10 mM [K(+)](o). Taken together  these results suggest that anticonvulsive effects of GABA are because of the combination of shunting and hyperpolarizing actions of GABA. Although shunting GABA is already efficient in the young age group  a developmental increase in the hyperpolarizing GABA(A) driving force likely contributes to the increase in the GABAergic control of seizures upon maturation."

These GABA concentrations activated low-conducting channels (&lt;40 pS) in 78% of the patches  22% of patches had channels with a maximum conductance above 40 pS. Alphaxalone at concentrations above 1 microM  and pregnanolone at concentrations above 0.1 microM  significantly increased the conductance of initially low-conducting single channels activated by GABA up to seven-fold and at all concentrations tested  both drugs increased open probability and mean open time and decreased closed probability and mean closed time of channels.

We have previously reported that ODN exerts a potent anorexigenic effect in rat and we have found that the action of ODN is not affected by the mixed CBR/PBR agonist diazepam. In the present report  we have tested the possible involvement of the metabotropic receptor in the anorexigenic activity of ODN. Intracerebroventricular administration of the C-terminal octapeptide (OP) and its head-to-tail cyclic analog cyclo(1-8)OP (cOP) at a dose of 100 ng mimicked the inhibitory effect of ODN on food intake in food-deprived mice. The specific CBR antagonist flumazenil and the PBR antagonist PK11195 did not prevent the effect of ODN  OP  and cOP on food consumption. In contrast  the selective metabotropic endozepine receptor antagonist cyclo(1-8)[DLeu(5)]OP (100-1000 ng; cDLOP) suppressed the anorexigenic effect of ODN  OP  and cOP. At the highest concentration tested (1000 ng)  cDLOP provoked by itself a significant increase in food intake. Taken together  the present results indicate that the anorexigenic effect of ODN and OP is mediated through activation of the metabotropic receptor recently characterized in astrocytes. The data also suggest that endogenous ODN  acting via this receptor  exerts an inhibitory tone on feeding behavior."

Cross-linking of two alpha1H109C subunits did not significantly change the affinity of [(3)H]muscimol or [(3)H]Ro15-1788 binding in alpha1H109Cbeta3gamma2 receptors  but GABA displayed a reduced potency for activating chloride currents. On reduction of the disulfide bond  however  GABA activation as well as diazepam modulation was similar in mutated and wild-type receptors  suggesting that these receptors exhibited the same subunit stoichiometry and arrangement. Disulfide bonds could not be reoxidized by copper phenanthroline after having been reduced in completely assembled receptors  suggesting that cross-linking can only occur at an early stage of assembly. The cross-link of alpha1H109C subunits and the subsequent transport of the resulting homodimers to the cell surface caused a reduction of the intracellular pool of alpha1H109C subunits and a reduced formation of completely assembled receptors. The formation of alpha1H109C homodimers as well as of correctly assembled GABA(A) receptors containing cross-linked alpha1H109C subunits could indicate that homodimerization of alpha1 subunits via contacts located in the channel mouth might be one starting point of GABA(A) receptor assembly. Alternatively the assembly mechanism might have started with the formation of heterodimers followed by a cross-link of mutated alpha1 subunits at the heterotrimeric stage. The formation of cross-linked alpha1H109C homodimers would then have occurred independently in a separate pathway."

Some smokers report less sedation during acute ethanol intoxication after nicotine administration and the sedative effects from ethanol are mediated by inhibitory GABA(A)-receptors. In a series of in vivo microdialysis experiments we investigated whether subchronic pre-treatment with nicotinic drugs known to enhance ethanol consumption in the rat (nicotine or the peripheral nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium) could modulate the alterations in extracellular dopamine observed in response to administration of ethanol or the sedative GABA(A)-agonist diazepam. In the nucleus accumbens and the dorsal striatum  systemic and/or local ethanol administration resulted in transient increases in extracellular dopamine levels that returned to baseline before the local levels of ethanol started to decline. In hexamethonium pre-treated rats  however  the nucleus accumbens dopamine levels were time-locked to the ethanol levels in the same area after systemic or local ethanol administration. Perfusion of diazepam into the nucleus accumbens produced a significant reduction in nucleus accumbens dopamine in controls. Prior subchronic treatment with nicotine or hexamethonium abolished this effect. The present results suggest that subchronic treatment with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist hexamethonium reduces a GABA(A)-R mediated counteraction of the nucleus accumbens dopamine response to ethanol. Additionally  we demonstrate that modulation of nicotinic receptors may reduce the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to benzodiazepines. These phenomena may offer a novel explanation to why nicotine and alcohol are often co-abused."

Nine ddY mice were used as a control. Once each week from the age of 5 to 19 weeks  the El mice received stimulation to produce epileptic seizures 20 minutes after receiving intraperitoneal injections. At 20 weeks of age  a total dose of 0.37 MBq of 125I-IMZ was injected in all mice and their brains were rapidly removed 3 hours later.

The Basic Protocol provides a procedure for analyzing benzodiazepine binding to GABA(A) receptors from brain. The experimental design of the method is suitable for all commercially available radioligands that interact with the BZ site of central GABA(A) receptors. By using the appropriate radioligand in combination with particular displacer compounds  individual (or groups of) GABA(A) receptor subtypes can be identified. Preparation of membrane suspensions for this procedure is described in a Support Protocol  and five Alternate Protocols are provided for the identification of diazepam-sensitive GABA(A) receptors  the a1-subtype of diazepam-sensitive receptors  the a5 subtype of diazepam-sensitive receptors  both diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive receptors  and diazepam-insensitive receptors exclusively. Each protocol contains a brief description of the requirements for radioligand binding to these five types of BZ sites."

Based on experimental studies that can reproduce these LC abnormalities in laboratory animals  we hypothesized that noradrenergic pathobiology in depression is a result of overactivity of the LC. LC activity is under the control of both excitatory and inhibitory inputs. A major inhibitory input to the LC is GABAergic  arising from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi. Numerous studies demonstrating low levels of GABA in the CSF and plasma of subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) raise the possibility that LC overactivity in depression may be secondary to reduced GABAergic input to the LC. Here  GABAergic input to the LC in depression was evaluated by studying the binding of [(3)H]flunitrazepam to GABA(A) receptors at three anatomically defined levels of the human postmortem LC. LC tissues were collected from subjects with MDD  subjects with depressive disorders including MDD that died as a result of suicide  and psychiatrically normal control subjects. A modest rostral-caudal gradient of GABA(A) receptor binding density was observed among all subjects. No significant differences in the amount of binding to GABA(A) receptors were observed between control subjects (n=21) and MDD subjects (n=9) or depressed suicide victims (n=17). These results demonstrate that GABA(A) receptor binding in the LC measured with [(3)H]flunitrazepam is not altered in subjects with depressive illnesses."
"511","17108175","The biochemical and neuroendocrine bases of the hyperalgesic nocebo effect.","Despite the increasing research on placebos in recent times  little is known about the nocebo effect  a phenomenon that is opposite to the placebo effect and whereby expectations of symptom worsening play a crucial role. By studying experimental ischemic arm pain in healthy volunteers and by using a neuropharmacological approach  we found that verbally induced nocebo hyperalgesia was associated to hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis  as assessed by means of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol plasma concentrations. Both nocebo hyperalgesia and HPA hyperactivity were antagonized by the benzodiazepine diazepam  suggesting that anxiety played a major role in these effects. The administration of the mixed cholecystokinin (CCK) type-A/B receptor antagonist proglumide blocked nocebo hyperalgesia completely but had no effect on HPA hyperactivity  which suggests a specific involvement of CCK in the hyperalgesic but not in the anxiety component of the nocebo effect. Importantly  both diazepam and proglumide did not show analgesic properties on basal pain  because they acted only on the nocebo-induced pain increase. These data indicate a close relationship between anxiety and nocebo hyperalgesia  in which the CCKergic systems play a key role in anxiety-induced hyperalgesia. These results  together with previous findings showing that placebo analgesia is mediated by endogenous opioids  suggest that the analgesic placebo/hyperalgesic nocebo phenomenon may involve the opposite activation of endogenous opioidergic and CCKergic systems."

Its neurobiological effects are  at least in part  mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors. Since GABA(A) receptor function is critical during brain development  the long-term effects of toluene exposure during brain growth spurt were investigated. Spargue-Dawley male rats were administered with toluene (500 mg/kg  i.p.) on postnatal day (PN) 4-9. Behavioral and electrophysiological measures and the levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits were examined on PN 28-32. The seizure sensitivity induced by bicuculline (a GABA(A) receptor antagonist)  methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (inverse agonists of the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor) but not 3-mercaptopropionic acid (a glutamate decarboxylase inhibitor) was enhanced by toluene exposure. Toluene exposure had no effect on the performance in the elevated plus-maze and rotarod test but reduced the responses to diazepam in these two tests. In vitro intracellular electrophysiological recordings employing brain slices from rats treated with toluene demonstrated a significant decrease in GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in CA1 neurons but an increased response to GABA perfusion. The relative abundance of the mRNAs encoding various subunits of GABA(A) receptor (alpha1  alpha2  alpha4  alpha5  alpha6  beta2  beta3  gamma2S  gamma2L) was examined in four brain regions (hippocampus  striatum  cortex  and cerebellum) by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. These results demonstrated that subunit- and brain area-selective alterations in GABA(A) receptors after toluene exposure during brain growth spurt. The alterations in GABA(A) receptors might be associated with the neurobehavioral disturbance in offspring of toluene-abusing women."

A 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic study.","Organophosphates  such as the nerve gas soman  cause inhibition of acetylcholine esterase  accumulation of acetylcholine in synaptic clefts  and excessive activation of cholinergic receptors  causing central nervous symptoms such as tremor and seizures. Soman-poisoned animals have low brain levels of ATP  indicating that energy demand is greater than energy supply. We investigated whether soman poisoning is accompanied by an increased brain metabolism of glucose  as can be inferred from the accumulation of radiolabeled 2-deoxyglucose found in previous studies  or whether soman poisoning entails impairment of cerebral energy metabolism. We performed 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on brain extracts from soman-poisoned mice (160 microg/kg; 1 LD50) that had been dosed with 13C-labeled glucose or pyruvate intravenously. Formation of 13C-labeled glutamate  GABA and glutamine from [1-(13)C]glucose was reduced by approximately 30% in awake  soman-intoxicated animals  but formation of these amino acids from [3-(13)C]pyruvate was not different in soman-intoxicated animals and controls. These results suggest that soman intoxication entails inhibition of glycolysis  but not of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity in the brain. However  when brain metabolism was depressed by a sedative dose of diazepam (5 mg/kg) soman intoxication caused increased metabolism of 13C-labeled glucose. The latter finding shows that the soman-poisoned brain has a high energy requirement even during anticonvulsant therapy. We conclude that metabolic inhibition  as seen in awake  soman-intoxicated animals  may lower seizure threshold and contribute to soman-related neurodegeneration and lethality."

We have recently identified FR260010 (N-[3-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)phenyl]-5 6-dihydrobenzo[h]quinazolin-4-amine dimethanesulfonate) as novel 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist from diaryl amine derivatives  and here characterized in vitro and in vivo profiles of the compound. FR260010 showed high affinity for human 5-HT(2C) receptor (K(i): 1.10 nM) and high selectivity over 5-hydroxytryptamine(2A) (5-HT(2A)) receptor (K(i): 386 nM) and many other transmitter receptors. FR260010 showed antagonist activity at human 5-HT(2C) receptor in an intracellular calcium assay and showed no detectable intrinsic activity. The compound dose-dependently inhibited the hypolocomotion (ID(50): 1.89 mg/kg  p.o.) and hypophagia (ID(50): 2.84 mg/kg  p.o.) in rats induced by m-CPP  putative indices of brain 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist activity. We then compared the effects of FR260010 with those of two other anxiolytics belonging to different classes  diazepam and buspirone  in anxiety models in rats and mice and adverse effect tests in mice. FR260010 (0.1-3.2 mg/kg  p.o.) and diazepam (1-10 mg/kg  p.o.) decreased behavioral indices of anxiety in all models  whereas buspirone (0.32-10 mg/kg  p.o.) did not significantly affect them in any models. In adverse effect tests  FR260010 and buspirone showed modest effects  whereas diazepam showed significant effects in all tests. These results suggest that FR260010 is a novel  potent  orally active and brain penetrable antagonist of 5-HT(2C) receptor  and may have therapeutic potential for treatment of anxiety  with more desirable profiles than benzodiazepines or 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor agonists."

In rodents  Cajal-Retzius cells are transient  being prevalent in the marginal zone of the embryonic neocortex and declining over the first two postnatal weeks. While studies have examined in postnatal neocortex the properties of GABA(A) receptors in Cajal-Retzius cells  less is known about their disposition at embryonic stages. Here  we combined patch-clamp electrophysiology and single-cell mRNA profiling to probe the expression of GABA(A) receptors in Cajal-Retzius cells. In embryonic neocortical slices  GABA elicited GABA(A) receptor-mediated current responses that were diazepam-insensitive and inhibited by Zn(2+)  a pharmacological profile consistent with expression of gamma-less GABA(A) receptor isoforms. Non-Cajal-Retzius cells in the same embryonic slices  on the other hand  were robustly potentiated by diazepam and were insensitive to Zn(2+)  typical of gamma-containing GABA(A) receptor isoforms  as were Cajal-Retzius cells in the postnatal neocortex. Single-cell mRNA profiling and immunohistochemistry confirmed expression of GABA(A) receptor gamma subunit transcript and protein  respectively  in individual reelin-expressing cells in the postnatal cortex but not in their embryonic counterparts. We conclude that Cajal-Retzius cells express gamma-less GABA(A) receptors at embryonic stages and switch to expressing gamma-containing GABA(A) receptor isoforms during postnatal neocortical development."

Benzodiazepines can decrease blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity when used for induction of anesthesia  but the sites and mechanisms of action are uncertain. In this study  we determined the effect of the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam on GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and the firing activity of rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM)-projecting PVN neurons. RVLM-projecting PVN neurons were retrogradely labeled by fluorescent microspheres injected into the RVLM in rats. Whole-cell and cell-attached recordings were performed on labeled PVN neurons in the hypothalamic brain slice. Bath application of 1-10 microM diazepam significantly increased the decay time constants of the GABAergic miniature IPSCs and evoked IPSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Also  diazepam significantly increased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs but not of miniature IPSCs. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil completely blocked the diazepam-induced increases in the amplitude and decay time constants of the evoked IPSCs. Furthermore  diazepam significantly decreased the firing activity of PVN-RVLM neurons that responded with increased firing to the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline. In contrast  diazepam had no significant effect on the firing activity of bicuculline-unresponsive PVN-RVLM neurons. This study provides new information that the benzodiazepine suppresses the firing activity of PVN presympathetic neurons by potentiation of GABAergic inputs."

Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor expression has been associated with tumor malignity  and its subcellular localization is important to define its function in tumor cells. We investigated the presence of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in Ehrlich tumor cells  and the in vitro effects of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors ligands on tumor cell proliferation. Our results demonstrate the presence of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in the nucleus of Ehrlich tumor cells (85.53+/-12.60%). They also show that diazepam and Ro5-4864 (peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor agonists) but not clonazepam (a molecule with low affinity for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor) decreased the percentage of tumor cells in G0-G1 phases and increased that of cells in S-G2-M phases. The effects of those agonists were prevented by PK11195 (a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) that did not produce effects by itself. Altogether  these data suggest that the presence of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor within the nucleus of Ehrlich tumor cells is associated with tumor malignity and proliferation capacity."

Increases in DBI and its mRNA expressions induced by sustained morphine (0.3 microM) exposure for 3 days were completely abolished by naloxone and nifedipine  but not by omega-agatoxin VIA and omega-conotoxin GIVA. Increase in [(3)H]diltiazem binding to the particulate fractions from the morphine-treated neurons was due to increased B(max) value with no changes in K(d) value. Western blot analysis on L-type high voltage-gated calcium channel (HVCC) subunits revealed the increased expressions of alpha1C  alpha1D  and alpha2/delta1 subunits and decreased of beta4 subunit expression  whereas expression of N- and P/Q-type HVCC subunits was not changed. These results indicate that morphine-induced increase in DBI mRNA expression is mediated via increased Ca(2+) entry through up-regulated L-type HVCCs."
"520","17016712","Vulnerability of long-term neurotoxicity of chlorpyrifos: effect on schedule-induced polydipsia and a delay discounting task.","INTRODUCTION: Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a common organophosphate (OP) insecticide that has been widely used in extensive agriculture as a pesticide. The primary mechanism of acute toxic action of OPs is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). However  targets other than AChE have been proposed to contribute to the acute lethal action and side effects of short- or long-term exposure to these compounds. Bekkedal et al. (Sci Total Environ 274:119-123;2001) showed that chronic administration of the OP trimethylolpropane phosphate (TMPP) reduces the number of schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) sessions necessary to induce asymptotic drinking level.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present work  rats were injected with 250 mg/kg CPF and 6 months later  its effect on schedule-induced polydipsia was evaluated. In addition  after stable levels of SIP  a pharmacological study was carried out to determine the implication of other systems in the long-term effects of OPs. Finally  these animals were evaluated in a delay discounting task  as a measure of impulsivity.RESULTS: Results indicate that the CPF group gives more licks to obtain the same amount of water than control rats (VHC). Moreover  the administration of diazepam produces an increased water intake in the CPF without any observable effect in VHC rats. Data of the delay discounting task show that CPF rats prefer an immediate reward and show a major impulsive choice.DISCUSSION: Taken together  our data confirm and extend the long-term behavioral effects of subcutaneous administration of CPF and point to a role for other systems that  besides AChE inhibition  contribute to the long-term neurotoxicity of CPF."

In the present study  we measured water contents in hippocampal slices as an in vitro model of edema formation. Excitotoxic conditions induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA  300 microM)  as well as ischemia induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)  caused cellular edema formation as indicated by an increase of slice water contents. In the presence of furosemide  an inhibitor of the Na K Cl-cotransporter  NMDA-induced edema were reduced by 64% while OGD-induced edema were unaffected. The same observation  i.e.  reduction of excitotoxic edema formation but no effect on ischemia-induced edema  was made with chloride transport inhibitors such as DIDS and niflumic acid. Under ischemic conditions  modulation of GABAA receptors by bicuculline  a GABA antagonist  or by diazepam  a GABAergic agonist  did not significantly affect edema formation. Further experiments demonstrated that low chloride conditions prevented NMDA-induced  but not OGD-induced  water influx. Omission of calcium ions had no effect. Our results show that NMDA-induced edema formation is highly dependent on chloride influx as it was prevented by low-chloride conditions and by various compounds that interfere with chloride influx. In contrast  OGD-induced edema observed in brain slices was not affected by modulators of chloride fluxes. The results are discussed with reference to ionic changes occurring during tissue ischemia."

We have developed transgenic mice overexpressing the full-length neurotrophin-3 receptor TrkC (TgNTRK3) in the central nervous system. TgNTRK3 mice show increased anxiety-like behavior and enhancement of panic reaction in the mouse defense test battery  along with an increase in the number and density of catecholaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase positive) neurons in locus coeruleus and substantia nigra. Furthermore  treatment of TgNTRK3 mice with diazepam significantly attenuated the anxiety-like behaviors in the plus maze. These results provide evidence for the involvement of TrkC in the development of noradrenergic neurons in the central nervous system with consequences on anxiety-like behavior and panic reaction. Thus  changes in TrkC expression levels could contribute to the phenotypic expression of panic disorder through a trophic effect on noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. Our results demonstrate that the elevated NT3-TrkC tone via overexpression of TrkC in the brain may constitute a molecular mechanism for the expression of anxiety and anxiety."

Cells expressing DBI mRNA were mostly observed in the arcuate nucleus  the median eminence and the ependyma bordering the third ventricle. In the median eminence and the ependyma bordering the third ventricule  the DBI gene expression was decreased in ADX rats and a single injection of corticosterone to ADX rats induced a significant increase in DBI gene expression at 3 and 12 h time intervals without completely restoring the basal DBI mRNA expression observed in intact mice. In the arcuate nucleus  ADX and corticosterone administration did not modify DBI mRNA expression. CX down-regulated DBI gene expression in the ependyma bordering the third ventricle. The administration of dihydrotestosterone (3-24 h) completely reversed the inhibitory effect of CX. In the median eminence and arcuate nucleus  neither CX or dihydrotestosterone administration modified DBI mRNA levels. These results suggest that the effects of glucocorticoids on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and androgens on the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis are mediated by DBI."

In control cells expressing alphabetagamma receptors alone  GABA activated single channels whose main conductance was 30 picosiemens (pS) with a subconductance state of 20 pS  and increasing the GABA concentration did not alter their conductance. In contrast  when GABA(A) receptors were co-expressed with GABARAP  the GABA-activated single channels displayed multiple  high conductances (&gt; or =40 pS)  and GABA (&gt; or =10 microM) was able to increase their conductance  up to a maximum of 60 pS. The mean open time of GABA-activated channels in control cells expressing alphabetagamma receptors alone was 2.3 +/- 0.1 ms for the main 30-pS channel and shorter for the subconductance state (20 pS  0.8 +/- 0.1 ms). Similar values were measured for the 30- and 20-pS channels active in patches from cells co-expressing GABARAP. However higher conductance channels (&gt; or =40 pS) remained open longer  irrespective of whether GABA or GABA plus diazepam activated them. Plotting mean open times against mean conductances revealed a linear relationship between these two parameters. Since high GABA concentrations increase both the maximum single channel conductance and mean open time of GABA(A) channels co-expressed with GABARAP  trafficking processes must influence ion channel properties. This suggests that the organization of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors may provide a range of distinct inhibitory currents in the brain and  further  provide differential drug responses."

Hyperpolarizing phasic GABAergic inhibition requires the activity of neuron-specific chloride-extruding potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC2 in adult CNS. However  the possible role of KCC2 in tonic GABAergic inhibition and the associated behaviors is unknown. Here  we have examined the role of KCC2 in phasic vs tonic GABA inhibition by measuring the behavioral effects of pharmacological agents that presumably enhance phasic vs tonic inhibition in mice that retain 15-20% of normal KCC2 protein levels. These KCC2-deficient mice show decreased sensitivity to diazepam-induced sedation and motor impairment consistent with the reported role for KCC2 in fast hyperpolarizing inhibition. In contrast  the mice exhibit normal responses to low-dose alcohol-induced motor impairment  gaboxadol-induced sedation  and neurosteroid-induced hypnosis; behaviors thought to be associated with tonic GABAergic inhibition. Electrophysiological recordings show that the tonic conductance is not affected.

The intercellular tight junction formation of PBMECs was examined by electron microscopy and measured by transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). The mRNA expression of several BBB transporters in PBMECs was determined by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction analysis. The in vitro permeability of 16 structurally diverse compounds  representing a range of passive diffusion and transporter-mediated mechanisms of brain penetration  was determined in PBMECs. Except for the perfusion flow rate marker diazepam  the BBB permeability of these compounds was determined either in our laboratory or as reported in literature using in situ brain perfusion technique in rats. Results in the present study showed that PBMECs had a high endothelium homogeneity  an mRNA expression of several BBB transporters  and high TEER values. Culturing with rat astrocyte-conditioned medium increased the TEER of PBMECs  but had no effect on the permeability of sucrose  a paracellular diffusion marker. The PBMEC permeability of lipophilic compounds measured under stirred conditions was greatly increased compared with that measured under unstirred conditions. The PBMEC permeability of the 15 test compounds  determined under the optimized study conditions  correlated with the in situ BBB permeability with an r2 of 0.60. Removal of the three system L substrates increased the r2 to 0.89. In conclusion  the present PBMEC model may be used to predict or rank the in vivo BBB permeability of new chemical entities in a drug discovery setting."

The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of T. populnea bark on cognitive functions  total cholesterol levels and cholinesterase activity in mice. A total of 312 mice divided into 52 different groups were employed in the present investigation. The ethanolic extract of T. populnea (TPE) was administered orally in three doses (100  200 and 400 mg/kg) for 7 successive days to different groups of young and aged mice. The learning and memory parameters were assessed using elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus. TPE (200 and 400 mg/kg  p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory of young and aged mice. TPE also reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg  i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg  i.p.). Furthermore  TPE reduced significantly the central (brain) cholinesterase activity in mice. TPE exhibited a remarkable cholesterol lowering property comparable to simvastatin (a standard drug) in the present study. Furthermore  we observed that  T. populnea bark possessed a powerful memory enhancing activity in mice. Since diminished cholinergic transmission and increased cholesterol levels appear to be responsible for development of amyloid plaques and dementia in Alzheimer patients  TPE may prove to be a useful medicine on account of its multifarious beneficial effects  such as memory improving property  cholesterol lowering  anticholinesterase and anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore  T. populnea bark appears to be a promising candidate for improving memory and it would be worthwhile to explore the potential of this plant in the management of Alzheimer patients."

Scans using PET revealed hemispheric differences in brain glucose consumption when scans with and without diazepam were compared. The findings suggest that unihemispheric reduction in blood flow and glucose metabolism in the hemisphere showing USW are important features of unihemispheric sleep. Functional scans may also help to elucidate the degree of hemispheric laterality of sensory and motor systems as well as in neurotransmitter or molecular mechanisms of unihemispheric sleep in delphinoid cetaceans. The findings also demonstrate the potential value of functional scans to explore other aspects of dolphin brain physiology as well as pathology."
"533","16842193","Development of ligands for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor.","The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) initially characterised as a high affinity binding site for diazepam  is densely distributed in most peripheral organs whilst only moderately expressed in the healthy brain. The predominant cell type expressing the PBR at regions of central nervous system (CNS) pathology are activated microglial cells. Under neuroinflammatory conditions there is an over-expression of PBR binding sites indicating that measurements of PBR density can act as a useful index of brain disease activity. The PBR is now considered a significant therapeutic and diagnostic target which has provided the impetus for PBR ligand development. There are several classes of PBR ligands available including benzodiazepines (Ro5-4864)  isoquinoline carboxamides (PK 11195)  indoleacetamides (FGIN-1-27)  phenoxyphenyl-acetamides (DAA1106) and pyrazolopyrimidines (DPA-713). Subsequent conformationally restrained isoquinoline and indoleacetamide analogues have been synthesised in an attempt to yield PBR ligands with superior affinity and brain kinetics. Even though the PBR has been linked to a number of biochemical processes  including cell proliferation  apoptosis  steroidogenesis  porphyrin transport and immunomodulation  its exact physiological role is yet to be deciphered. Selective PBR ligands with favourable in vivo binding properties and kinetics is required to gain a more complete understanding on the normal functioning of the PBR and the chemical pathways underlying several pathological conditions. Novel PBR ligands with unique binding properties and functional activity may also generate information on the localisation of the PBR and the possibility of PBR subtypes. This review highlights the main classes of PBR ligands to date. In addition the biological activity and therapeutic potential of certain PBR ligands is discussed."

Distribution and quantity of nerve cells positive in glutamic acid (Glu) or gamma-aminobutyric acid (gamma-GABA) in the brain of mice were detected by immunohistochemical methods and micro-image analysis. The time of death time and survival rate were observed and compared between the varied groups of mice injected intraperitoneally with diazepam and phenobarbital sodium  respectively  0.5 h after poisoning by fipronil at dose of 90 mg/kg.RESULTS: All the mice acutely poisoned by fipronil at varied doses showed some exciting symptoms in the central nervous system (CNS)  including convulsion. Nuclear membrane space slightly expanded  neuroglia cells vacuolized and nerve fiber demyelinated under electron microscopy. The number and area of cells positive in Glu in the cerebral cortex of mice acutely poisoned by fipronil increased significantly  as compared to those in control mice. There was no significant difference in the number and area of cells positive in gamma-GABA in the hippocampal CA(1) region between poisoned and normal control groups. Survival rate of mice treated with diazepam or phenobarbital sodium was 58 percent.CONCLUSION: Mice with acute poisoning by fipronil appeared exciting symptoms in CNS  leading to damage in its nerve cells. Immunohistochemical techniques showed the damage could be related with the over-expression of glutamate transmitter in CNS. Early use of diazepam or phenobarbital sodium in treatment for acutely poisoned mice by fipronil could get better therapeutic efficacy."

Here  we studied whether distinct GABA(A)R subtypes mediate these various forms of inhibition using as approach mice carrying a point mutation in the alpha-subunit rendering individual GABA(A)R subtypes insensitive to diazepam without altering their GABA sensitivity and expression of receptors. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in hippocampal pyramidal cells from single  double  and triple mutant mice. Comparing diazepam effects in knock-in and wild-type mice allowed determining the contribution of alpha1  alpha2  alpha3  and alpha5 subunits containing GABA(A)Rs to phasic and tonic forms of inhibition. Fast phasic currents were mediated by synaptic alpha2-GABA(A)Rs on the soma and by synaptic alpha1-GABA(A)Rs on the dendrites. No contribution of alpha3- or alpha5-GABA(A)Rs was detectable. Slow phasic currents were produced by both synaptic and perisynaptic GABA(A)Rs  judged by their strong sensitivity to blockade of GABA reuptake. In the CA1 area  but not in the subiculum  perisynaptic alpha5-GABA(A)Rs contributed to slow phasic currents. In the CA1 area  the diazepam-sensitive component of tonic inhibition also involved activation of alpha5-GABA(A)Rs and slow phasic and tonic signals shared overlapping pools of receptors. These results show that the major forms of inhibitory neurotransmission in hippocampal pyramidal cells are mediated by distinct GABA(A)Rs subtypes."

By using a transgenic mouse model carrying the murine Y(1)R gene promoter fused to the lacZ reporter gene (Y(1)R/LacZ mice)  we showed that prolonged pharmacologically or physiologically induced changes in the cerebrocortical concentrations of the neuroactive steroids 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan- 20-one (3alpha 5alpha TH PROG) and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3alpha 5alpha TH DOC) increases Y(1)R/LacZ transgene expression in the central and medial amygdala  an effect similar to that induced by long-term treatment with positive modulators of the GABA(A) receptor complex (diazepam or abecarnil). We also demonstrated that fluctuations in the cerebrocortical concentrations of 3alpha 5alpha-TH PROG and 3alpha 5alpha TH DOC during voluntary ethanol consumption and ethanol withdrawal induces a marked increase in Y(1)R gene expression that becomes apparent 48 h after withdrawal. These data provide evidence that neuroactive steroids may play an important role in the functional interaction between the GABA(A) receptor and NPY-Y(1)R mediated pathways in the amygdala  which might represent an important regulatory mechanism for modulation of several functions  including ethanol withdrawal."

Inhibition is mediated through a diversity of different interneurones and gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABA(A)R) subtypes. Here we employed paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI)  a GABA(A)R-mediated inhibition in human motor cortex  to address the question of which GABA(A)R subtype is responsible for this form of inhibition. It has been shown that classical benzodiazepines (diazepam and lorazepam) have a non-selective affinity profile at different alpha-subunit-bearing subtypes of the GABA(A)R while zolpidem has a 10-fold greater affinity to the alpha1-subunit-bearing GABA(A)R compared with those bearing the alpha2- or alpha3-subunit. We found that  in seven healthy subjects  a single oral dose of 20 mg of diazepam or 2.5 mg of lorazepam significantly increased SICI  whereas 10 mg of zolpidem did not change SICI. This dissociation occurred despite equal sedation by all three drugs  an alpha1-subunit GABA(A)R-mediated effect. The findings strongly suggest that SICI is not mediated by the alpha1-subunit-bearing subtype of the GABA(A)R but by those bearing either the alpha2- or alpha3-subunit. This study represents an attempt by means of TMS to identify GABA(A)R subtype-specific action at the systems level of human cortex  a highly relevant issue because the different alpha-subunit-bearing subtypes of the GABA(A)R are differently involved in benzodiazepine-mediated effects such as sedation  amnesia or anxiolysis  in developmental cortical plasticity  and in neurological disorders such as epilepsy."

The lower limits of the working ranges of these assays were set at 25 ng/mL and 0.5 microg/mL  respectively  and are below the lowest pharmacologically active plasma concentrations of these drugs. Intra- and interday coefficients of variations were less than 2.5% and 11.0% throughout  as determined with six replicates (n = 6). These assays were accurate in that the relative difference between actually measured and expected concentration never exceeded 12%.

This mixture  including the internal standard diazepam  was used for transport studies in Transwell models using Caco-2  ECV304  and PBMEC/C1-2 cell lines. Samples were analyzed by fluorimetry  capillary electrophoresis  and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.RESULTS: Following this approach  a logarithm correlation of R2 = 0.8958 between transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and APTS-dextran permeability was shown. In addition  a TEER-dependent permeability pattern could be observed including each single fraction from free APTS  APTS-glucose up to APTS-dextran consisting of 35 glucose units. The TEER-independent permeability coefficients of diazepam and confocal laser scanning microscopy images confirmed the paracellular transport of APTS-dextran.CONCLUSIONS: All in all  the developed APTS-dextran ladder is a useful tool to characterize cell layer tightness and especially to describe paracellular transport ways and the extent of leakiness of cell layers (for blood-brain barrier or intestinal studies) over time--applying a wide array from smaller to larger molecules at the same time to refine TEER  sucrose  or Evans blue measurements."

Caspase-8 cleaves Bid  which releases cytochrome c  bridging the &quot;extrinsic&quot; and &quot;intrinsic&quot; pathways. Cleavage of Bid may amplify caspase-8-induced neuronal cell death following seizures. In the present study  we explored the effect of an inhibitor of caspase-8 (z-IETD-fmk) on the release of Smac/DIABLO and cytochrome c from mitochondria. Rats received intra-amygdaloid injection of kainic acid (KA) to induce seizures for 1 h. The seizures were then terminated by diazepam (30 mg/kg). The damaged and surviving neurons in hippocampus were observed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and cresyl violet staining  the expression of caspase-8  Bid  XIAP  caspase-9  cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO were detected with immunofluorescence and Western blot. The cleavage of caspase-8 and Bid increased at 0 h  cytosolic fraction of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO increased by 2 h  cleavage of caspase-9 was detected by 4 h  TUNEL-positive neurons appeared at 8 h and reached a maximum at 24 h following administration of diazepam in the ipsilateral CA3 subfield of hippocampus. Inhibition of caspase-8 significantly decreased neuronal cell death  accompanied by reduction of t-Bid  cleaved caspase-9 and cytosol cytochrome c. Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria was not affected. These results suggest that seizures can lead the translocation of cytochrome c into the cytosol  and the activation of caspase-8 occurs upstream the mitochondria release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO. Inhibition of caspase-8 attenuated neuronal cell death following seizures by decreasing mitochondria release of cytochrome c but not Smac/DIABLO."

The ethanolic extract of Daucus carota seeds (DCE) was administered orally in three doses (100  200  400 mg/kg) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam-  scopolamine- and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. DCE (200  400 mg/kg  p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. The extent of memory improvement evoked by DCE was 23% at the dose of 200 mg/kg and 35% at the dose of 400 mg/kg in young mice using elevated plus maze. Similarly  significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice. Furthermore  DCE reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg  i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg  i.p.). Daucus carota extract (200  400 mg/kg  p.o.) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mice. The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by DCE at the dose of 400 mg/kg was 22% in young and 19% in aged mice. There was a remarkable reduction in total cholesterol level as well  to the extent of 23% in young and 21% in aged animals with this dose of DCE. Therefore  DCE may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as  memory improving property  cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity."

After testing the behavioral action of the benzodiazepines on the open field and the elevated plus-maze  the effects of the three drugs on neuronal metabolism of particular limbic regions were measured using cytochrome c oxidase (CO) histochemistry. Diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.) and alprazolam (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced clear anxiolytic effects and a decrease in locomotion  whereas zolpidem (2 mg/kg i.p.) caused an intense hypnotic effect. The anxiolytic effects of alprazolam were distinguishable from diazepam due to the pharmacological and clinical profile of this triazolobenzodiazepine. CO activity decreased significantly in almost all the limbic regions evaluated after zolpidem administration. However  significant prominent decreases in CO activity were found after diazepam treatment in the medial mammillary nucleus  anteroventral thalamus  cingulate cortex  dentate gyrus and basolateral amygdala. Alprazolam caused similar decreases in CO activity  with the exception of the prelimbic and cingulate cortices  where significant increases were detected. In agreement with previous studies using other functional mapping techniques  our results indicate that particular benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics induce selective changes in brain oxidative metabolism."
"546","16627857","Insertion of alpha7 nicotinic receptors at neocortical layer V GABAergic synapses is induced by a benzodiazepine, midazolam.","Benzodiazepines act mainly at postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors. In rat neocortical layer V pyramidal neurons  we found that midazolam (MDZ)  a benzodiazepine  increases the frequency of GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) via insertion of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at presynaptic GABAergic boutons. Although nicotine alone had no effect  MDZ plus nicotine dramatically increased mIPSC frequency. Neostigmine  an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor  mimicked the actions of nicotine. MDZ increased the number of alpha-bungarotoxin-bound boutons that were blocked by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors  as revealed by confocal imaging of a neuron-synaptic bouton preparation. Thus  MDZ may induce membrane translocation of alpha7 nAChRs on GABAergic boutons via activation of PKC  enabling endogenous acetylcholine to increase GABA release. The above actions seem unique to MDZ because neither other benzodiazepines (diazepam and flunitrazepam) nor zolpidem had this effect. The findings reveal both a novel cholinergic modulatory mechanism affecting GABAergic transmission and a novel action of some general anesthetics."

At the end of each treatment  freezing and feeding were measured. Only the animals exposed to inescapable footshock paradigm showed significant increase in the food intake and freezing behavior in comparison to the control animals. The MCH administration (intra-hippocampal or intra-amygdaline) reverted these effects elicited by inescapable footshock.

Radioligand binding and electrophysiology were used to study the effects of LCM at well-established mammalian targets for clinical anticonvulsants. 10 microM LCM did not bind with high affinity to a plethora of rodent  guinea pig or human receptor sites including: AMPA; Kainate; NMDA (glycine/PCP/MK801); GABA(A) (muscimol/benzodiazepine); GABA(B); adenosine A1 2 3; alpha1  alpha2; beta1  beta2; M1 2 3 4 5; H1 2 3; CB1 2; D1 2 3 4 5; 5HT1A 1B 2A 2C 3 5A 6 7 and KATP. Weak displacement (25%) was evident at batrachotoxin site 2 on voltage gated Na+ channels. LCM did not inhibit neurotransmitter transport mechanisms for norepinephrine  dopamine  5-HT or GABA  nor did it inhibit GABA transaminase. LCM at 100 microM produced a significant reduction in the incidence of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC's) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC's) in cultured cortical cells and blocked spontaneous action potentials (EC50 61 microM). LCM did not alter resting membrane potential or passive membrane properties following application of voltage ramps between -70 to +20 mV. The voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) blocker phenytoin potently blocked sustained repetitive firing (SRF) but  in contrast  100 microM LCM failed to block SRF. No effect was observed on voltage-clamped Ca2+ channels (T-  L-  N- or P-type). Delayed-rectifier or A-type potassium currents were not modulated by LCM (100 microM). LCM did not mimic the effects of diazepam as an allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptor currents  nor did it significantly modulate evoked excitatory neurotransmission mediated by NMDA or AMPA receptors (n &gt; or = 5). Evidently LCM perturbs excitability in primary cortical cultures but does not appear to do so via a high-affinity interaction with an acknowledged recognition site on a target for existing antiepileptic drugs."

Here  we show that delta subunit-containing receptors bind the imidazo-benzodiazepines (BZs) flumazenil and Ro15-4513 with high affinity (K(d) &lt; 10 nM)  contrary to the widely held belief that these receptors are insensitive to BZs. In immunopurified native cerebellar and recombinant delta subunit-containing receptors  binding of the alcohol antagonist [(3)H]Ro15-4513 is inhibited by low concentrations of EtOH (K(i) approximately 8 mM). Also  Ro15-4513 binding is inhibited by BZ-site ligands that have been shown to reverse the behavioral alcohol antagonism of Ro15-4513 (i.e.  flumazenil  beta-carbolinecarboxylate ethyl ester (beta-CCE)  and N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG7142)  but not including any classical BZ agonists like diazepam). Experiments that were designed to distinguish between a competitive and allosteric mechanism suggest that EtOH and Ro15-4513 occupy a mutually exclusive binding site. The fact that only Ro15-4513  but not flumazenil  can inhibit the EtOH effect  and that Ro15-4513 differs from flumazenil by only a single group in the molecule (an azido group at the C7 position of the BZ ring) suggest that this azido group in Ro15-4513 might be the area that overlaps with the alcohol-binding site. Our findings  combined with previous observations that Ro15-4513 is a behavioral alcohol antagonist  suggest that many of the behavioral effects of EtOH at relevant physiological concentrations are mediated by EtOH/Ro15-4513-sensitive GABA(A) receptors."

However  picrotoxin did not antagonize the effect of valproate on clonic seizure latency at all. Flumazenil  a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist  was found to have an inhibitory effect on the anticonvulsant action of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg). The incidence of tonic extensor was 83.3% in flumazenil (10 mg/kg)-treated group  0% in the diazepam (0.5 mg/kg)-treated group  and 83% in the flumazenil plus diazepam-treated group as well as the control group. Flumazenil also completely reversed the effect of diazepam on clonic seizure latency. In biochemical experiments  the concentration of the inhibitory amino acid  GABA  was significantly increased in the hippocampus (P&lt;0.05) and cerebellum (P&lt;0.01) in diazepam-treated animals. The increase of GABA in the hippocampus and cerebellum was antagonized by the administration of flumazenil. These results suggested that the anticonvulsant action of diazepam may be linked to increase in hippocampus and cerebellum GABA concentrations. The findings suggest that the mechanism of flurothyl-induced seizures  in part  is related to the highly sensitive benzodiazepine site of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex."

GABA in the brain is commonly associated with a fast  point-to-point form of signalling called synaptic transmission (phasic inhibition)  but there is growing evidence that GABA participates in another  slower and more diffuse form of signalling often referred to as tonic inhibition. Unresolved questions regarding tonic neuronal inhibition concern activation and functional properties of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (GABARex) present on neurones. Extrasynaptic receptors are exposed to submicromolar GABA concentrations and may modulate the overall excitability of neurones and neuronal networks.

"554","16554486","Contributions of the GABAA receptor alpha6 subunit to phasic and tonic inhibition revealed by a naturally occurring polymorphism in the alpha6 gene.","GABAA receptors (GABARs) are heteromultimeric proteins composed of five subunits. The specific subunit composition determines critical properties of a GABAR such as pharmacological sensitivities and whether the receptor contributes to synaptic or extrasynaptic forms of inhibition. Classically  synaptic but not extrasynaptic GABARs are thought to respond to benzodiazepines  whereas the reverse has been suggested for ethanol. To examine the effects of subunit composition on GABAR function in situ  we took advantage of two naturally occurring alleles of the rat gene for GABAR subunit alpha6 (Gabra6(100R) and Gabra6(100Q)). Depending on their subunit partners  these two variants of alpha6 can lead to differential sensitivities to benzodiazepines and ethanol. An examination of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA-mediated currents in cerebellar granule cells from Gabra6(100R/100R) and Gabra6(100Q/100Q) rats uncovered marked allele-dependent differences in benzodiazepine sensitivity. Unexpectedly  we found that the benzodiazepines flunitrazepam and diazepam enhanced extrasynaptic inhibition mediated by delta subunit-containing GABARs in Gabra6(100Q/100Q) rats. Complementary experiments on recombinant GABARs confirmed that  at subsaturating [GABA]  flunitrazepam potentiates alpha6/delta subunit-containing GABARs. Based on data and a simple theoretical analysis  we estimate that the average extrasynaptic [GABA] is approximately 160 nm in perfused slices. These results (1) demonstrate contributions of alpha6 subunits to both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA responses  (2) establish that delta subunit-containing GABARs are benzodiazepine sensitive at subsaturating [GABA] and  (3) provide an empirical estimate of extrasynaptic [GABA] in slices."
"555","16537521","Imidazenil and diazepam increase locomotor activity in mice exposed to protracted social isolation.","In cortex and hippocampus  protracted (&gt;4 weeks) social isolation of adult male mice alters the subunit expression of GABA type A receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) as follows: (i) the mRNAs encoding GABA(A)-R alpha1  alpha2  and gamma2 subunits are decreased by approximately 50%  whereas those encoding alpha4 and alpha5 subunits are increased by approximately 100%; (ii) similarly  the synaptic membrane expression of the alpha1 subunit protein is down-regulated  and that of the alpha5 subunit protein is up-regulated; and (iii) the binding of [(3)H]flumazenil to hippocampal synaptic membranes is decreased. Behaviorally  socially isolated (SI) mice are resistant to the sedative effects of the positive allosteric GABA(A)-R modulators diazepam (DZP) and zolpidem. This resistance seems to be attributable to the decrease of alpha1-containing GABA(A)-Rs. Paradoxically  DZP  which  unlike zolpidem  acts at alpha5-containing GABA(A)-Rs  increases the locomotor activity of SI mice. Imidazenil  which fails to modulate alpha1-  alpha4-  and alpha6-containing GABA(A)-Rs but is a selective positive allosteric modulator of alpha5-containing GABA(A)-Rs  also increases locomotor activity in SI mice. Importantly  SI mice responded to muscimol  4 5 6 7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5 4-c]pyridin-3(2H)-one  and allopregnanolone similar to group-housed mice. These data suggest that a switch (a decrease in alpha1/alpha2 and gamma2 and an increase in alpha4 and alpha5 subunits) in the composition of the heteropentameric GABA(A)-R subunit assembly without a change in total GABA(A)-R number occurs during social isolation. Thus  the repertoire of DZP and imidazenil actions in SI mice appears to be elicited by the allosteric modulation of GABA(A)-Rs overexpressing alpha5 subunits. Benzodiazepine response mediated by alpha1-containing GABA(A)-Rs is expected to be silent or reduced."

Changes in the level of anxiety can affect some cognitive functions such as memory  attention and inhibitory response control. We investigated the effects of NPY Y2 receptor deletion (Y2(-/-)) in mice on visual attention and response control using the five-choice serial reaction time (5-CSRT) task in which accuracy of detection of a brief visual stimulus across five spatial locations may serve as a valid behavioural index of attentional functioning. Anticipatory and perseverative responses provide a measure of inhibitory response control. During training  the Y2(-/-) mice had lower accuracy (% correct)  and made more anticipatory responses. At stimulus durations of 2 and 4s the Y2(-/-) were as accurate as the Y2(+/+) mice but still more impulsive than Y(+/+). At stimulus durations of 0.25 and 0.5s both groups performed worse but the Y2(-/-) mice made significantly fewer correct responses than the Y2(+/+) controls. The anxiolytic drug diazepam at 2mg/kg IP greatly increased the anticipatory responding of Y2(-/-) mice compared to Y2(+/+). The anxiogenic inverse benzodiazepine agonist  FG 7142  at 10mg/kg IP reduced the anticipatory responding of Y2(-/-) but not Y2(+/+) mice. These data suggest that NPY Y2 receptors make an important contribution to mechanisms controlling attentional functioning and &quot;impulsivity&quot;. They also show that &quot;impulsivity&quot; of NPY Y2(-/-) mice may depend on their level of anxiety. These findings may help in understanding the pathophysiology of stress disorders and depression."

Stimulated rats were assigned to one of three treatment groups  receiving intraperitoneal injections of saline  200 mg/kg LEV  or 1 000 mg/kg LEV  15 min into SSSE and at 3 times over the next 44-h period. All animals received diazepam after 3-h SSSE to terminate seizures. Forty-four hours later  the hippocampi were extracted and prepared for electrochemical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  to measure reduced glutathione levels  and for spectrophotometric assays to measure activities of mitochondrial enzymes (aconitase  alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase  citrate synthase  complex I  and complex II/III). These parameters were compared between treatment groups and with sham-operated rats.RESULTS: LEV administration did not terminate seizures or have any significant effect on spike frequency  although rats that received 1 000 mg/kg LEV did exhibit improved behavioral seizure parameters. Significant biochemical changes occurred in saline-treated stimulated rats compared with shams: with reductions in glutathione  alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase  aconitase  citrate synthase  and complex I activities. Complex II/III activities were unchanged throughout. Rats that received 1 000 mg/kg LEV had significantly improved biochemical parameters  in many instances  comparable to sham control levels.CONCLUSIONS: Despite continuing seizures  administration of LEV (1 000 mg/kg) protects against mitochondrial dysfunction  indicating that in addition to its antiepileptic actions  LEV may have neuroprotective effects."

However  the antidepressant-like activity of Koso-san has never been evaluated scientifically. In this study  ddY mice subjected to a combination of forced swimming and chronic mild stresses were termed depression-like model mice. The degree of the depression-like state was measured by the animal's duration of immobility using the forced swimming test (FST). Oral administration of Koso-san (1.0 g/kg/body wt./day  9 days) significantly shortened the duration of immobility of the depression-like model mice in the FST; however  locomotor activity was not affected. Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression. Levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA expression in the hypothalamus and proopiomelanocortin mRNA expression in the pituitary were significantly increased  and glucocorticoid receptor protein expression in the hypothalamus paraventricular nucleus was downregulated in the depression-like model mice. However  Koso-san ameliorated these alterations to the normal conditions. The results of this study suggest that Koso-san shows the antidepressant-like effect through suppressing the hyperactivity of the HPA axis in depression-like model mice."

The authors examined in subjects with schizophrenia the effect in the human BDNF gene of a single nucleotide polymorphism (Val66Met)  which reduces the trafficking and secretion of BDNF protein  on the expression of GAD(67) mRNA.METHOD: BDNF Val66Met genotyping was performed in 27 matched pairs of schizophrenia and comparison subjects. The impact of this polymorphism on prefrontal cortex GAD(67) mRNA expression in schizophrenia subjects was assessed by comparing within-pair differences in GAD(67) mRNA expression between schizophrenia subjects with versus without the Met66 allele after the level of BDNF mRNA expression was controlled.RESULTS: In contrast to expectations  the within-pair reduction in GAD(67) mRNA expression was not greater in schizophrenia subjects who were hetero- or homozygous for the Met66 allele. These subjects did tend to exhibit less marked within-pair reductions in both GAD(67) and BDNF mRNA expression compared with schizophrenia subjects homozygous for the Val allele.CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the BDNF Met66 allele does not contribute to the decreased level of GAD(67) mRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia."

CRF is the principal modulator of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis  in addition to acting on many other areas of the central nervous system. We compared nociceptive thresholds (heat and mechanical) and pain behavior in response to a sustained stimulus (formalin test) between Fischer and Lewis rats that have different HPA axis activity. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of CRF produced dose-dependent antinociception at a lower dose in Lewis (40 ng  paw pinch 71+/-0 g) compared to Fischer rats (200 ng  112+/-3 g). The antinociceptive effect of CRF was mostly preserved in adrenalectomized Fischer rats. The i.c.v. administration of the CRF receptor antagonist  astressin  had a hyperalgesic effect  suggesting that CRF is tonically active. Lewis rats required higher doses of astressin (5 ng  paw pinch 51+/-1 g) to show nociceptive effects compared to Fischer rats (1 ng  79+/-1 g). Only Lewis rats vocalized during mechanical stimulus  and this behavior was prevented by diazepam or morphine but was worsened by CRF  despite its antinociceptive property. In the formalin test  CRF and astressin had the largest effect on the interphase suggesting that they act on the endogenous pain inhibitory system. CRF also increased anxiety/fear-like behaviors in the forced swim and predator odor tests. Our results establish that central CRF is a key modulator of pain behavior and indicates that CRF effects on nociception are largely independent of its mood modulating effect as well as its control of the HPA axis."

Since MDMA induces &quot;ecstasy&quot; it is extensively used as a &quot;recreational&quot; drug. It has been well established that MDMA is neurotoxic and can result in long-term degeneration of cerebral 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) nerve terminals in many species. The present study was undertaken to investigate the long-term neurotoxic effects of MDMA on cortical and hippocampal structures  by repeatedly administering MDMA in short time. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to control group and MDMA-treated group. MDMA (10 mg/kg) was administered to rats of MDMA-treated group  once per hour  total 40 mg/kg; rats of control group were treated with the same volume of saline. Thirty-two weeks after administering MDMA  the expression of serotonin transporter (SERT) mRNA and diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was detected by immunohistochemistry  and the degeneration of nerve terminals was demonstrated by Bielschowsky and Glee Marsland silver staining. The results showed that the expression of SERT mRNA in hippocampus decreased by 31.96%  while expression of DBI mRNA in neocortex increased by 40.51%  compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05). The expression of GFAP in the brain tissue increased (P&lt;0.05)  while significant reduction of the nerve terminals in neocortex was demonstrated by silver staining  compared with the control group. These results suggest that the neurotoxicity of MDMA results in sustained cortical and hippocampal structural changes  which in turn result in disorder of the brain functions."

In the central nervous system (CNS)  the Rho signaling pathway regulates the neuronal response to growth inhibitory proteins and regeneration of damaged axons  and Rho activation is also correlated with an increased susceptibility to apoptosis. To evaluate whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in changes in Rho activation in vulnerable regions of the brain  GTP-RhoA pull down assays were performed on rat cortical and hippocampal tissue homogenates obtained from 24 h to 3 days following lateral fluid percussion brain injury (FPI). Following FPI  a significantly increased RhoA activation was observed from 24 h to 3 days post-injury in the cortex and by 3 days in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the injury. We also detected activated RhoA in the cortex and hippocampus contralateral to the injury  without concomitant changes in total RhoA levels. To determine if immediate post-traumatic events such as seizures may activate Rho  we examined RhoA activation in the brains of rats with kainic acid-induced seizures. Severe seizures resulted in bilateral RhoA activation in the cortex and hippocampus. Together  these results indicate that RhoA is activated in vulnerable brain regions following traumatic and epileptic insults to the CNS."

We compared seven anesthetic/sedative agents applied after injury in the controlled cortical impact model: diazepam  fentanyl  isoflurane  ketamine  morphine  pentobarbital  and propofol. Our objective was to provide insight into the relative degrees of neuroprotection provided by these agents in a standard model of TBI. We hypothesized that the choice of anesthetic/sedative early after experimental TBI critically impacts outcome and that the agents most commonly used clinically may be less neuroprotective than isoflurane. Rats treated with isoflurane had the best cognitive recovery (p &lt; 0.05) and hippocampal neuronal survival (p &lt; 0.05). Conversely  rats treated with ketamine had the most hippocampal neuronal death (p &lt; 0.05). Morphine or propofol  two agents commonly used clinically  were associated with the poorest motor function on post-trauma day 1-5 (p &lt; 0.05). Our data support beneficial effects of isoflurane early after experimental TBI. Our data suggest that the early post-TBI use of isoflurane  despite practical logistical issues  could potentially provide clinical benefits in TBI--versus other commonly used sedatives or analgesics. Furthermore  the choice of post-injury sedation and analgesia could have important implications on attempts to translate novel therapies from bench to field or bedside."

The present study aimed to examine the contribution of the 5-HT system originating in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) to the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol in male Wistar rats. Therefore  selective lesions of 5-HT neurons in the DRN were induced by microinfusions of 5 7-dihydroxytryptamine. The DRN- and sham-lesioned rats were trained to discriminate ethanol (1.0 g/kg) from saline in a standard two-lever drug discrimination procedure. Acquisition of ethanol discrimination and discrimination performance after consumption of lower doses of ethanol did not differ between the groups. In substitution tests  diazepam (0.5-2.5 mg/kg)  a nonselective benzodiazepine receptor agonist  partially generalized from the ethanol cue in both groups. In contrast  m-chlorophenylpiperazine (0.1-0.9 mg/kg)  a mixed 5-HT(1B/2C) receptor agonist  did not mimic the ethanol cue. The drug decreased response rates in both groups  but this effect was more evident in the sham-lesioned group. A 5-HT1A receptor agonist  8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyloamino)-tetraline (0.05-0.4 mg/kg)  did not produce significant increase in ethanol-appropriate responding in either group. These results may indicate that 5-HT neurons of the DRN are not critically involved in ethanol discrimination in the rat."

Pregnant dams were injected over gestation days 14 through 20 with DZ (2.5 mg/kg) or the vehicle. Male and female offspring were analyzed at five postnatal ages. The levels of progesterone (P)  dihydroprogesterone (DHP)  3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha 5alpha-THP)  testosterone (T)  dihydrotestosterone  and 5alpha-androstan-3alpha 17beta diol were measured in the cerebral cortex and diencephalon. The results indicated that development of brain steroid levels and the impact of fetal DZ exposure were region- and sex-specific. Age-related changes in brain steroids did not mirror associated changes in circulating P and T. Age regulated the levels of all 3 progestins in the cerebral cortex  and fetal DZ exposure interacted with the development of P and DHP. The development of 3alpha 5alpha-THP in the cortex was markedly influenced by sex  with levels in males decreasing over postnatal development whereas they increased over postpubertal development in females. An adolescent surge in T levels was observed in male cortex and fetal DZ exposure prevented that surge. Steroid levels in the diencephalon were altered by age mainly in females  and DZ exposure had little effect in this region. The data support region-specific regulation of brain steroid synthesis. Only in the cerebral cortex are relevant mechanisms readily modifiable by fetal DZ exposure. However  neither sex nor fetal DZ exposure altered the response of GABA(A) receptors in adult cortex to neurosteroid."

We have reported previously that IL-1 markedly enhances excitotoxic injury induced in the rat by striatal administration of the excitotoxin alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)  leading to widespread neuronal loss throughout the ipsilateral cortex. Here we tested the hypothesis that IL-1 causes this injury through induction and/or enhancement of seizure activity in the rat. Consistently with this hypothesis  intrastriatal injection of AMPA or AMPA with IL-1 in the rat brain increased c-Fos expression in regions similar to those in which c-Fos has been reported previously in response to seizures. A significant increase in cortical neuronal activity (number of c-Fos positive cells) was observed in response to AMPA with IL-1 compared with AMPA (8 hr after injection). Increased seizure duration [3 522 +/- 660 sec (SEM) vs. 1 415 +/- 301 sec; P &lt; 0.001] and cell death volume (140 +/- 20 mm3 vs. 52 +/- 6 mm3; P &lt; 0.001) were seen in response to coinfusion of AMPA with IL-1 vs. AMPA alone. In addition  the anticonvulsant diazepam (intraperitoneal) significantly reduced cell death (P &lt; 0.001) and seizure duration (P &lt; 0.001) induced by AMPA with IL-1  and a significant correlation was found between seizure duration and cell death volume. These findings support our hypothesis that IL-1 enhances excitotoxic injury by enhancement of seizures  which may be of relevance to IL-1 actions in other forms of neuronal injury  including cerebral ischemia."
"575","16339085","Ambient GABA promotes cortical entry of tangentially migrating cells derived from the medial ganglionic eminence.","During corticogenesis  cells from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) migrate tangentially into the neocortical anlage. Here we report that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)  via GABAA receptors  regulates tangential migration. In embryonic telencephalic slices  bicuculline produced an outward current in migrating MGE-derived cells in the neocortex  suggesting the presence of and tonic activation by ambient GABA. Ambient GABA was also present in the MGE  although this required demonstration using as bioassay HEK293 cells expressing high-affinity alpha6/beta2/gamma2s recombinant GABAA receptors. The concentration of ambient GABA was 0.5+/-0.1 microM in both regions. MGE-derived cells before the corticostriate juncture (CSJ) were less responsive to GABA than those in the neocortex  and profiling of GABAA receptor subunit transcripts revealed different expression patterns in the MGE vis-à-vis the neocortex. These findings suggest a dynamic expression of GABAA receptor number or isoform as MGE-derived cells enter the neocortex and become tonically influenced by ambient GABA. Treatment with bicuculline or antibody against GABA did not affect migration of MGE-derived cells before the CSJ but decreased &quot;crossing index &quot; reflecting impeded migration past the CSJ into the neocortex. Treatment with diazepam or addition of exogenous GABA increased crossing index. We conclude that ambient GABA promotes cortical entry of tangentially migrating MGE-derived cells."

BIC follow a favorable course and disappear before 2-3 years of age  although convulsions for which diazepam is ineffective frequently develop. We treated 15 children (3-16 months of age) diagnosed as having BIC  excluding convulsions associated with mild gastroenteritis  with a once-daily dose of 5mg/kg of carbamazepine until up to 2 or 3 years of age. The serum concentration of carbamazepine was as low as below the effective range in six patients  but the treatment was dramatically effective in all the BIC children. Seizures did not recur in any patients during oral administration of carbamazepine. The treatment was finished in 12 patients at age 2 years  two at age 3 years  and one at 16 months-old. Therefore  we recommend the administration of a once-daily dose of 5mg/kg of carbamazepine until up to 2 or 3 years of age as a treatment for BIC."

Using in vivo microdialysis technique  we measured extracellular lactate concentrations in the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus (BLA) of rats under electric footshock or psychological stress. We also attempted to determine whether the stress-induced changes of extracellular lactate concentrations in the BLA are attenuated by diazepam  an agonist at benzodiazepine receptors  and whether FG7142  an inverse agonist at benzodiazepine receptors  have a facilitative effect on energy metabolism in the BLA. Both footshock and psychological stress led to an increase in extracellular lactate concentrations in the BLA. Similar increment of extracellular lactate levels was observed by administration of FG7142. Pretreatment with diazepam attenuated the ability of FG7142  as well as physical or psychological burden  to increase lactate levels in the BLA. These results indicate that a variety of stressors enhances energy metabolism in the BLA  and suggest that some stress-induced changes in energy metabolism are regulated by benzodiazepine receptors."

(+/-)-1-(2 5-Dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI; a 5-HT2A receptor agonist) also possessed strong anxiolytic-like effect in the same test. A 5-HT2A mechanism seems to be implicated in the mechanism of action of both antidepressants and DOI in this test. On the other hand  the alpha-adrenergic ligands have also demonstrated an activity in other models of anxiety. A previous study demonstrated that the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists abolished the anxiolytic-like effect of antidepressants.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of noradrenergic system on the regulation of 5-HT2 receptors implicated in the DOI anxiolytic-like activity in the FPT.METHODS: First  the effect of noradrenergic and serotonergic lesions on DOI anxiolytic-like activity was studied in the FPT. Second  the effect of co-administration of alpha-adrenoceptor ligands and DOI was evaluated in the same test.RESULTS: The noradrenergic and serotonergic lesions had no effect on DOI (1 mg/kg) anti-punishment activity in the FPT. Adrafinil 0.25 and 4 mg/kg (an alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist)  prazosin 0.5 and 2 mg/kg (an alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist) and idazoxan 1 and 4 mg/kg (an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist) did not modify the activity of DOI. Clonidine 0.06 mg/kg  guanabenz 0.125 and 0.5 mg/kg (two alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists) and guanfacine 0.06 and 0.125 mg/kg (a specific alpha2A-adrenoceptor agonist) completely abolished DOI-induced increase in punished passages.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the DOI seems to act on the 5-HT2 receptors post-synaptically located. The effect of DOI is regulated by the alpha2-adrenoceptors."

These nuclei project to neural areas implicated in reinforcing effects of drugs  indicating that they could participate in opiate reward. The objectives were to study the morphological characteristics of the dopamine network of the RLi/PAG region  and to discern its role on rewarding and sensitizing effects of heroin in rats  following dopamine depletion or local injection of dopaminergic antagonists. The findings indicated that this network is composed of small cells in the RLi/ventral PAG  large multipolar dopamine PAG neurons  and periaqueductal PAG neurons. Following repeated heroin  large PAG neurons and small RLi/ventral PAG cells (not periaqueductal neurons) were activated  since tyrosine-hydroxylase was adaptively induced  without changes in protein kinase Aalpha. After dopamine depletion  small RLi/ventral PAG neurons and large cells of the PAG (not periaqueductal ones) were selectively affected by the neurotoxin. Dopamine neurons of the nearby VTA and dorsal raphe were not affected  as revealed by cell counting. After lesion  'anxiety-like' responses and basal locomotion were not altered. However  conditioned place preference to heroin was found to be abolished  as well as heroin-induced motor sensitization. Following infusions of dopaminergic antagonists into RLi/PAG  D(2) (not D(1)) receptor blocking dose-dependently abolished heroin-induced reward. The present study provides evidence that dopamine neurons of the RLi/PAG region (excluding PAG periaqueductal cells) show adaptive biochemical changes after heroin  and mediate the rewarding and sensitizing effects of this drug. D(2) dopamine receptors within the RLi/PAG region participate in these effects."
"581","16284244","A schizophrenia-related sensorimotor deficit links alpha 3-containing GABAA receptors to a dopamine hyperfunction.","Overactivity of the dopaminergic system in the brain is considered to be a contributing factor to the development and symptomatology of schizophrenia. Therefore  the GABAergic control of dopamine functions was assessed by disrupting the gene encoding the alpha3 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor. alpha3 knockout (alpha3KO) mice exhibited neither an obvious developmental defect nor apparent morphological brain abnormalities  and there was no evidence for compensatory up-regulation of other major GABA(A)-receptor subunits. Anxiety-related behavior in the elevated-plus-maze test was undisturbed  and the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam  which is mediated by alpha2-containing GABA(A) receptors  was preserved. As a result of the loss of alpha3 GABA(A) receptors  the GABA-induced whole-cell current recorded from midbrain dopamine neurons was significantly reduced. Spontaneous locomotor activity was slightly elevated in alpha3KO mice. Most notably  prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex was markedly attenuated in the alpha3KO mice  pointing to a deficit in sensorimotor information processing. This deficit was completely normalized by treatment with the antipsychotic D2-receptor antagonist haloperidol. The amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion was not altered in alpha3KO mice compared with WT mice. These results suggest that the absence of alpha3-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors induces a hyperdopaminergic phenotype  including a severe deficit in sensorimotor gating  a common feature among psychiatric conditions  including schizophrenia. Hence  agonists acting at alpha3-containing GABA(A) receptors may constitute an avenue for an effective treatment of sensorimotor-gating deficits in various psychiatric conditions."
"582","16256358","Antiepileptic drug-resistant rats differ from drug-responsive rats in hippocampal neurodegeneration and GABA(A) receptor ligand binding in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy.","The disabling seizures associated with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are often resistant to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The biological basis of this refractoriness is unknown but may include alterations in AED targets in the epileptogenic brain tissue  reduced AED penetration to the seizure focus  and neuropathological brain alterations such as hippocampal sclerosis typically found in patients with refractory TLE. In the present study  we used a rat model of TLE to examine whether AED responders differ from non-responders in their structural alterations and GABA(A) receptor characteristics in the hippocampal formation. In this model  spontaneous recurrent seizures develop after a status epilepticus induced by prolonged electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala. The frequency of these seizures was recorded by continuous video/EEG monitoring before  during  and after daily treatment with phenobarbital  which was given at maximum tolerated doses for 2 weeks. Based on their individual response to phenobarbital  rats were grouped into responders and non-responders. The severity or duration of the initial brain insult (the status epilepticus) did not differ between responders and non-responders  indicating that the difference between the two subgroups is genetically determined. Subsequent histological examination showed a significant loss of neurons in the CA1  CA3c/CA4  and dentate hilus of non-responders  whereas responders did not differ in this respect from non-epileptic controls. The morphological alterations in the non-responders were associated with striking alterations in autoradiographic imaging of diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive GABA(A) receptor binding in the dentate gyrus with a significant shift to enhanced diazepam-insensitive binding. The present data indicate that neurodegeneration and associated GABA(A) receptor changes in the dentate gyrus are critically involved in the mechanisms underlying refractoriness of seizures in TLE."

Dextrans were labeled by reductive amination with fluorescent 1-aminopyrene-3 6 8-trisulfonate (APTS). This mixture  including internal standard diazepam  was used for transport studies  which were accomplished with an established transwell blood-brain barrier model culturing an immortalized porcine brain microvascular endothelial cell line (PBMEC/C1-2). Samples were analyzed by fluorescence measurements  capillary electrophoresis and RP-LC. Following this approach  a permeability pattern could be achieved including each single fraction from APTS  APTS-glucose to APTS-dextran consisting of 31 glucose units. Permeability coefficients were calculated and ranged from 16.38+/-3.79 microm/min for APTS to 6.07+/-1.23 microm/min for the APTS-dextran with 31 glucose units (diazepam: 67.97+/-7.32 microm/min). All in all  the developed APTS-dextran ladder is an useful tool to characterize cell layer tightness--especially to describe paracellular transport ways and leakiness status of the blood-brain barrier over time--applying a wide range from smaller to larger molecules at the same time in order to refine  e.g. TEER  sucrose or Evans blue measurements."

Most patients with stupor have a diffuse organic cerebral dysfunction. Rarely stupor is recurrent and no specific causes can be found. Patients with idiopathic recurrent stupor were awakened by i.v. administration of an antagonist (flumazenil) of the benzodiazepine recognition site located in the GABA(A) receptor. Since no exogenous benzodiazepines were detected in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid by high performance liquid chromatography  an excess of endogenous benzodiazepine-like compounds (endozepines) was proposed as the cause of stupor. The existence of endozepines  their widespread distribution in the CNS and their involvement in hepatic encephalopathy are established. However  the origin of these compounds  how biosynthesis occurs and the mechanisms and causes through which they alter brain functions are poorly understood. The fact that a number of synthetic benzodiazepines are difficult to detect using conventional techniques and the discovery that some cases of recurrent stupor were caused by fraudulent administration of lorazepam question whether the concept of endozepine recurrent stupor can be sustained. This review summarizes the state of endozepine physiology and pharmacology and the clinical syndromes attributed to their involvement. A diagnostic work-up to define endozepine-induced recurrent stupor is suggested."
"585","16222299","Repeated cocaine exposure in vivo facilitates LTP induction in midbrain dopamine neurons.","Drugs of abuse are known to cause persistent modification of neural circuits  leading to addictive behaviours. Changes in synaptic plasticity in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) may contribute to circuit modification induced by many drugs of abuse  including cocaine. Here we report that  following repeated exposure to cocaine in vivo  excitatory synapses to rat VTA dopamine neurons become highly susceptible to the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity. This facilitated LTP induction is caused by cocaine-induced reduction of GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor-mediated inhibition of these dopamine neurons. In midbrain slices from rats treated with saline or a single dose of cocaine  LTP could not be induced in VTA dopamine neurons unless GABA-mediated inhibition was reduced by bicuculline or picrotoxin. However  LTP became readily inducible in slices from rats treated repeatedly with cocaine; this LTP induction was prevented by enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition using diazepam. Furthermore  repeated cocaine exposure reduced the amplitude of GABA-mediated synaptic currents and increased the probability of spike initiation in VTA dopamine neurons. This cocaine-induced enhancement of synaptic plasticity in the VTA may be important for the formation of drug-associated memory."

During this session  the WP rats received auditory and olfactory stimulation coming from a PS pair submitted to unavoidable electric footshocks (1 mA  dc  0.5s  0.5c/s  10 min).

Evaluation of anxiety-related animal behavior was performed by measuring the percent of time spent on the open arms and the percent of open-arm entries as conventional anxiety indices. The number of times displaying risk-assessment from a closed arm was also measured as an ethological anxiety index. Diazepam  an anxiolytic agent  enhanced the percent of time spent on the open arms and the percent of open-arm entries. The number of times displaying risk-assessment was not affected by diazepam in the present study. The percent of time on the open arms were depressed  and the number of times displaying risk-assessment were stimulated by 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP)  indicating that TFMPP acts as an anxiogenic agent. (Z)-3-Hexenol revealed anxiolytic activity and increased the percent of time spent on the open arms and decreased the number of times displaying risk-assessment. In the neurochemical study  diazepam had no effect on the content of 5-HT and its metabolite in the brain cortex or hippocampus. On the other hand  TFMPP inhibited the 5-HT turnover rate accompanied by the elevation of the 5-HT content and reduction of the 5-HIAA content in the brain cortex and hippocampus. (Z)-3-Hexenol significantly increased the 5-HT content without affecting the 5-HIAA content or the 5-HT turnover rate in the brain cortex or hippocampus.

One line of support indicates that immediate-early gene (IEG) expression (e.g.  c-fos and egr-1 (zif268)) is increased in these nuclei following fear conditioning. Other research finds that anxiogenic drugs working through various mechanisms induce IEG expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) suggesting that expression is a neural marker for fear and anxiety. However  several studies have also found that anxiolytic drugs induce IEG expression in the CeA. Expression of egr-1 in the CeA and lateral nucleus of the amygdala following administration of anxiolytic and anxiogenic benzodiazepine and serotonin agonists and antagonists was investigated. The first experiment determined behaviorally active anxiolytic and anxiogenic doses for two anxiogenic drugs (FG 7142 and mCPP) and two anxiolytic drugs (diazepam and buspirone). The effects of anxiogenic and anxiolytic doses of these drugs on egr-1 expression in the amygdala were then tested in a second experiment. All four drugs increased egr-1 in the CeA indicating that increased egr-1 mRNA expression in the CeA is not specific to anxiolytic or anxiogenic effects of the drugs. We suggest that IEG expression in the CeA may be due to activation of circuits that are associated with systemic physiological homeostasis perturbed by a number of drugs including anxiogenic and anxiolytic compounds."

However  the corresponding binding site of GABAA receptors containing either an alpha4 or alpha6 subunit do not bind the classical BZs and are therefore diazepam-insensitive (DIS) receptors; a difference attributable to a single amino acid (histidine in alpha1  alpha2  alpha3 and alpha5 subunits and arginine in alpha4 and alpha6). Unlike classical BZs  the imidazobenzodiazepines Ro 15-4513 and bretazenil bind to both DS and DIS populations of GABAA receptors. In the present study  an in vivo assay was developed using lorazepam to fully occupy DS receptors such that [3H]Ro 15-4513 was then only able to bind to DIS receptors. When dosed i.v.  [3H]Ro 15-4513 rapidly entered and was cleared from the brain  with approximately 70% of brain radioactivity being membrane-bound. Essentially all membrane binding to DS+DIS receptors could be displaced by unlabelled Ro 15-4513 or bretazenil  with respective ID50 values of 0.35 and 1.2 mg kg(-1). A dose of 30 mg kg(-1) lorazepam was used to block all DS receptors in a [3H]Ro 15-1788 in vivo binding assay. When predosed in a [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding assay  lorazepam blocked [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to DS receptors  with the remaining binding to DIS receptors accounting for 5 and 23% of the total (DS plus DIS) receptors in the forebrain and cerebellum  respectively. The in vivo binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513 to DIS receptors in the presence of lorazepam was confirmed using alpha1H101R knock-in mice  in which alpha1-containing GABAA receptors are rendered diazepam insensitive by mutation of the histidine that confers diazepam sensitivity to arginine. In these mice  and in the presence of lorazepam  there was an increase of in vivo [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding in the forebrain and cerebellum from 4 and 15% to 36 and 59% of the total (i.e. DS plus DIS) [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding observed in the absence of lorazepam."

We have used this mutant to test an approach of therapeutic intervention prior to seizure onset by daily injection with diazepam during either the first or second postnatal week. Results showed differences between postnatal week 1 and week 2 injections both acutely  with respect to sedative effects  and in long-term outcome  with respect to EEG and behavioral tests measured at 12-14 weeks of age. The EEG of control mice remained unaffected under all conditions  but the EEG of beta3 (-/-) injected with diazepam in week 1 was worsened  showing increased oscillatory activity at 5-6Hz  and more myoclonic jerks  particularly among males. For beta3 (-/-) injected with diazepam in week 2  the EEG was normalized in half the mice but worsened similarly to week 1 in the other half. Neonatal diazepam injection had a long-term normalizing effect on behavior of beta3 (-/-) mice injected in week 1  but diazepam treatment in week 2 did not affect the hyperactive and circling behavior characteristic of the beta3 knockout mouse. Diazepam treatment in postnatal week 2 significantly decreased anxiety in the adult beta3 group. Diazepam treatment in both postnatal weeks 1 and 2 improved the motor coordination of beta3 (-/-) on the rotarod  although performance of control mice injected with diazepam in postnatal week 2 was significantly impaired. The observed long-term outcome of neonatal diazepam injections may result from interference with developmental processes  and shows that enhancing GABAergic activity with diazepam during the period where GABA can be excitatory can produce narrow stage-related effects on brain development."

In order to investigate the role and mechanism of action of ODN in the regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the paraventricular nucleus and arcuate nucleus  respectively  we studied the effects of the acute intracerebroventricular administration of ODN (2 microg/rat) and the ODN antagonist to metabotropic receptor  cyclo(1-8)[Dleu5]OP (20 microg/rat)  on the gene expression of the two neuropeptides in castrated male rat. ODN administration resulted in a 45% increase in CRH mRNA expression  an effect which was reversed by cyclo(1-8)[Dleu5]OP. When cyclo(1-8)[Dleu5]OP was administered alone  it induced a 19% decrease in CRH mRNA levels. ODN administration induced a 17% decrease in NPY mRNA expression while cyclo(1-8)[Dleu5]OP increased by 21% the hybridization signal. The administration of both ODN and ODN antagonist completely abolished the depressing effect of ODN on NPY mRNA. These data suggest that the effects of ODN on CRH and NPY mRNA might be mediated by interaction with metabotropic receptors. Moreover  since cyclo(1-8)[Dleu5]OP can by itself influence the expression of two peptide mRNAs  it might be suggested that ODN is exerting a tonic influence on NPY and CRH neurons."

Therefore  with the establishment of a soman-induced seizures model in rats  this study evaluated the efficacy in preventing soman-induced convulsions of two antagonists of both the M and N receptors  phencynonate hydrochloride (PCH) and penehyclidine hydrochloride (8018)  which were synthesized by our institute  and of other anticholinergic drugs  and investigated the mechanisms of their antiseizures responses. Male rats  previously prepared with electrodes to record electroencephalographic (EEG) activity  were pretreated with the oxime HI-6 (125 mg kg-1  i.p.) 30 min before they were administered soman (180 microg kg-1  s.c.). All animals developed seizures subsequent to this treatment. Different drugs were given at different times (5  20 and 40 min after seizures onset) and their anticonvulsant effects were monitored and compared using the two variables  i.e. the dose that could totally control the ongoing seizures  as well as the speed of seizures control. The anticonvulsant effects of atropine  scopolamine and 8018 decreased with the progression of the seizures  and they eventually lost their anticonvulsant activity when the seizures had progressed for 40 min. In contrast  PCH showed good anticonvulsant effectiveness at 5 and 20 min  and especially at 40 min after seizures onset. Of the anticholinergic drugs tested  atropine  scopolamine  and 8018 showed no obvious protection against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsions or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced lethality in mice. However  PCH antagonized the PTZ-induced convulsions in a dose-dependant manner with an ED50 of 10.8 mg kg-1  i.p. (range of 7.1-15.2 mg kg-1) and partly blocked the lethal effects of NMDA in mice. PCH also dose-dependently inhibited NMDA-induced injury in rat primary hippocampal neuronal cultures  suggesting a possible neuroprotective action in vivo. In conclusion  our study suggests that the mechanisms of PCH action against soman-induced seizures might differ from those of the M receptor antagonists atropine and scopolamine  and that of the antagonist of both the M and N receptors  8018. The pharmacological profile of PCH might include anticholinergic and anti-NMDA properties. Compared with the currently recommended anticonvulsant drug diazepam  with known NMDA receptor antagonists such as MK-801 and with conventional anticholinergics such as scopolamine and atropine  the potent anticonvulsant effects of PCH during the entire initial 40 min period of soman poisoning  and its fewer adverse effects  all suggest that PCH might serve as a new type of anticonvulsant for the treatment of seizures induced by soman."
"593","16125698","Effects of benzodiazepines receptor agonists on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis.","Previous studies have demonstrated that classical benzodiazepines decrease hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical cortex (HPA) axis activity. Paradoxically  high doses of benzodiazepines also stimulate basal circulating corticosterone levels in some conditions. Because benzodiazepine agonists display little selectivity to any of the alpha subtypes of the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor to which they bind  we propose that the unequivocal results are due to an alpha subtype-dependent modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical cortex axis output. To test this  basal hormonal output and induction of Fos in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus were measured after administration of various benzodiazepine ligands in mice. Zolpidem  a selective alpha1 subtype agonist  produced a very strong increase in plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone whereas the inverse agonist FG7142 induced a small rise in plasma corticosterone. More surprisingly  the non-selective full agonists diazepam and zopiclone induced a lower increase in circulating corticosterone than after zolpidem. In contrast  the alpha(2 3 5)-selective benzodiazepine agonist and alpha1 antagonist L-838 417 had no effect on corticosterone levels. Strong induction of Fos in the paraventricular nucleus was found in response to zolpidem  diazepam  and zopiclone  but not after L-838 417. Finally  pre-administration of L-838 417 prior to zolpidem strongly inhibited the effect of zolpidem on corticosterone. Likewise  the non-selective agonists diazepam and zopiclone at a dose that alone had no effect on corticosterone also inhibited the effect of zolpidem. Taken together  these results suggest that benzodiazepine ligands modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical cortex axis through partly opposite mechanisms; and that the net effect is dependent on the composition of the GABA(A) receptor subunits to which they bind."

We found that either injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or neuropathic pain induced by sciatic nerve ligation produced a significant anxiogenic effect at 4 weeks after the injection or surgery. Under these conditions  the selective mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2 N-MePhe4 Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO)- and the selective delta-opioid receptor agonist (+)-4-[(alphaR)-alpha-((2S 5R)-4-allyl-2 5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N N-diethylbenzamide (SNC80)-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding in membranes of the amygdala was significantly suppressed by CFA injection or nerve ligation. CFA injection was associated with a significant increase in the kappa-opioid receptor agonist 2-(3 4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)ethyl]acetamide hydrochloride (ICI199 441)-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding in membranes of the amygdala. The intracerebroventricular administration and microinjection of a selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist  a selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist  and the endogenous kappa-opioid receptor ligand dynorphin A caused a significant anxiogenic effect in mice. We also found that thermal hyperalgesia induced by sciatic nerve ligation was reversed at 8 weeks after surgery. In the light-dark test  the time spent in the lit compartment was not changed at 8 weeks after surgery. Collectively  the present data constitute the first evidence that chronic pain has an anxiogenic effect in mice. This phenomenon may be associated with changes in opioidergic function in the amygdala."

Activation of endogenous opioid systems is known to occur in response to stress and a growing body of literature suggests that opioid systems regulate the properties of anxiolytic drugs. These experiments sought to elucidate the role of opioid receptors in the central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) nuclei of the amygdala in regulating the anxiolytic properties of ethanol and diazepam. Male rats fitted with cannula received bilateral microinjections of the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (NAL) immediately followed by systemic delivery of either ethanol (1 g/kg) or diazepam (2 mg/kg) in the elevated plus maze. Both diazepam and ethanol decreased anxiety-like behavior. Delivery of NAL into the CeA blocked the anxiolytic properties of diazepam. Delivery of NAL into the BLA slightly increased open arm avoidance  but had no effect on the anxiolytic properties of diazepam. Microinjection of NAL into either nucleus failed to block the effects of ethanol. These results were specific to the anxiolytic properties of diazepam  since baseline behaviors were unaffected by microinjection of NAL. Microinjection of lidocaine produced results distinct from NAL and failed to block the anxiolytic actions of diazepam. These studies indicate distinct roles for opioid receptor systems in the CeA and BLA in regulating the anxiolytic properties of diazepam in the elevated plus maze. Further  opioid receptor systems in the CeA and BLA do not regulate the anxiolytic properties of ethanol in this test."
"596","16111724","Selective cortical VGLUT1 increase as a marker for antidepressant activity.","The two recently characterized vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT) presynaptically mark and differentiate two distinct excitatory neuronal populations and thus define a cortical and a subcortical glutamatergic system (VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 positive  respectively). These two systems might be differentially implicated in brain neuropathology. Still  little is known on the modalities of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 regulations in response to pharmacological or physiological stimuli. Given the importance of cortical neuronal activity in psychosis we investigated VGLUT1 mRNA and protein expression in response to chronic treatment with commonly prescribed psychotropic medications. We show that agents with antidepressant activity  namely the antidepressants fluoxetine and desipramine  the atypical antipsychotic clozapine  and the mood stabilizer lithium increased VGLUT1 mRNA expression in neurons of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus and in concert enhanced VGLUT1 protein expression in their projection fields. In contrast the typical antipsychotic haloperidol  the cognitive enhancers memantine and tacrine  and the anxiolytic diazepam were without effect. We suggest that VGLUT1 could be a useful marker for antidepressant activity. Furthermore  adaptive changes in VGLUT1 positive neurons could constitute a common functional endpoint for structurally unrelated antidepressants  representing promising antidepressant targets in tracking specificity  mechanism  and onset at action."

Exposure of rat hippocampal neurons in culture to 10 microM etizolam for 5 days reduced the amounts of alpha5 and gamma2S receptor subunit mRNAs  whereas etizolam withdrawal was associated with a persistent reduction in gamma2S mRNA and an increase in alpha2 and alpha3 mRNAs. Neither chronic exposure to nor withdrawal of etizolam affected the acute modulatory effects of etizolam or lorazepam on GABA-evoked Cl- current. Treatment with 10 microM lorazepam for 5 days reduced the amounts of alpha1 and gamma2S subunit mRNAs and increased that of alpha3 mRNA  whereas lorazepam withdrawal was associated with persistence of the changes in alpha3 and gamma2S mRNAs and an increase in alpha2 and alpha4 mRNAs. Parallel changes in the abundance of alpha1 and alpha4 subunit proteins induced by chronic exposure to and withdrawal of lorazepam  but not etizolam  were detected by immunocytofluorescence analysis. Chronic lorazepam treatment resulted in a reversible reduction in the modulatory efficacy of this drug and conferred on flumazenil the ability to potentiate GABA-evoked Cl- current. The anticonvulsant action of etizolam was not altered in mice chronically treated with this drug  whereas lorazepam-treated animals became tolerant to the acute anticonvulsant effect of this benzodiazepine. These data suggest that etizolam is endowed with a reduced liability to induce tolerance and dependence compared with classical benzodiazepines."

In this study  catalase activity was determined in homogenates of striatum (ST) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) in order to examine the participation of oxidative stress (OS) on cocaine actions in mice brain. Male Swiss mice were injected (i.p.) with cocaine at low (10 and 30 mg/kg) and high doses (90 mg/kg)  and observed for 1 h. After cocaine overdose (90 mg/kg) some animals presented only status epilepticus (SE) while others died after seizures. These animals were dissected and divided in two groups  SE and death. Catalase activity was also determined after pretreatment with the anticonvulsant drug  diazepam  alone or injected before cocaine 90 mg/kg  and after seizures induced by a high dose of bupropion  a known inhibitor of NE and DA reuptake used for comparison. Results showed a decrease in catalase activity of the PFC and ST after SE and death induced by cocaine and bupropion overdoses. Cocaine at low doses decreased the enzyme activity only in ST. Diazepam treatment alone and before cocaine overdose did not interfere with catalase activity. This reduction in catalase activity may reflect an increase in H2O2 content in PFC and ST. Previous data reports that H2O2 inhibits dopamine transporter activity  suggesting that the decrease in catalase activity may potentiate the toxic mechanism of drugs that inhibit monoamines reuptake. As far as we know  this is the first report showing an involvement of OS in the cocaine's central mechanism of action."

Prolonged occupancy of these receptors by ligands leads to regulatory changes often resulting in reduction of receptor function. The mechanism of these changes is still unknown. In this study  stably transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were used as a model to study the effects of prolonged flumazenil (antagonist of benzodiazepine binding sites at GABA(A) receptors) exposure on the recombinant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptors  the most common type of GABA(A) receptors found in the brain. Exposure (48 h) of HEK 293 cells stably expressing recombinant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptors to flumazenil (1 or 5 microM) in the presence of GABA (1 microM)  enhanced the maximum number (B(max)) without affecting the affinity (K(d)) of [(3)H]TBOB labeled binding sites for convulsants. Diazepam (1 nM-1 mM) in the presence of GABA (1 microM) modulated [(3)H]TBOB binding to control and flumazenil pretreated cells according to a two-site model. No significant differences between the groups were observed in either the potency or efficacy of diazepam to modulate [(3)H]TBOB binding  as evidenced by a lack of significant changes between their IC(50) and I(max) values. The results suggest that chronic exposure of HEK 293 cells stably expressing recombinant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptors to flumazenil up-regulates the binding sites for convulsants  but it does not appear to affect the functional coupling between these sites and benzodiazepine binding sites. Along with our recent data  these results suggest that chronic treatment with flumazenil enhances the number of GABA(A) receptors."

Methyldigoxin in a concentration of 0.1 mmol/l inhibits enzyme activity by 80 %. Verapamil  propranolol and promethazine in concentrations of 20  20 and 2 mmol/l respectively  entirely inhibit the ATPase activity. Carbamazepine and diazepam in concentrations of 0.02-60 mmol/l have no effect on the activity of this enzyme. According to the drug concentrations that inhibit 50 % of enzyme activity (IC(50))  the potency can be listed in the following order: methyldigoxin promethazine verapamil ? propranolol. From the inhibition of commercially available purified Na K-ATPase isolated from porcine cerebral cortex in the presence of chosen drugs  as well as from kinetic studies on synaptosomal plasma membranes  it may be concluded that the drugs inhibit enzyme activity  partly by acting directly on the enzyme proteins. Propranolol  verapamil and promethazine inhibitions acted in an uncompetitive manner. The results suggest that these three drugs may contribute to neurological dysfunctions and indicate the necessity to take into consideration the side effects of the investigated drugs during the treatment of various pathological conditions."

Ethanol administration continued from delivery up to weaning. The open field  elevated plus maze and forced swimming tests were used to evaluate effects of ethanol on locomotion  anxiety and depression  respectively. Binding assays were used to identify dopaminergic (D1- and D2-like) and muscarinic (M1 plus M2) receptors. Results of the plus maze test indicated significant and dose-dependent increases in the number of entrances in the open arms and in the time of permanence in the open arms  in the prenatally ethanol-exposed offspring  as compared to controls  indicating an anxiolytic effect. In the open field test  this group presented decreases in spontaneous locomotor activity as well as in the occurrences of rearing and grooming. Offspring also showed dose-dependent increases in their immobility time in the forced swimming test  characterizing despair behavior. Decreases in the hippocampal (D2: 32%; D1: 25%) and striatal (D2: 30%; D1: 52%) dopaminergic binding were detected in ethanol-exposed offspring. On the other hand  significant increases were observed in muscarinic binding in the hippocampus (40%) as well as in the striatum (42%). This study shows evidence that in utero ethanol exposure produces a long-lasting effect on development and pharmacological characteristics of brain systems that may have important implications in behavioral and neurochemical responsiveness occurring in adulthood."

Here  we examined the effects of Abeta on biosynthesis and release of diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI)  a polypeptide primarily expressed by astroglial cells in the CNS. Quantitative RT-PCR and specific radioimmunoassay demonstrated that aggregated Abeta(25-35)  at concentrations up to 10(-4) m  induced a dose-dependent increase in DBI mRNA expression and DBI-related peptide release from cultured rat astrocytes. These effects were totally suppressed when aggregation of Abeta(25-35) was prevented by Congo red. Measurement of the number of living cells revealed that Abeta(25-35) induced a trophic rather than a toxic effect on astrocytes. Administration of cycloheximide blocked Abeta(25-35)-induced increase of DBI gene expression and endozepine accumulation in astrocytes  indicating that protein synthesis is required for DBI gene expression. Altogether  the present data suggest that Abeta-induced activation of endozepine biosynthesis and release may contribute to astrocyte proliferation associated with Alzheimer's disease."

Because rat astrocytes express various subtypes of somatostatin receptors (sst)  we have investigated the effect of somatostatin on DBI mRNA level and endozepine secretion in rat astrocytes in secondary culture. Somatostatin reduced in a concentration-dependent manner the level of DBI mRNA in cultured astrocytes. This inhibitory effect was mimicked by the selective sst4 receptor agonist L803-087 but not by the selective sst1  sst2 and sst3 receptor agonists L779-591  L779-976 and L797-778  respectively. Somatostatin was unable to further reduce DBI mRNA level in the presence of the MEK inhibitor U0126. Somatostatin and the sst1  sst2 and sst4 receptor agonists induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of endozepine release. Somatostatin and the sst1  sst2 and sst4 receptor agonists also inhibited cAMP formation dose-dependently. In addition  somatostatin reduced forskolin-induced endozepine release. H89 mimicked the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on endozepine secretion. In contrast the PLC inhibitor U73122  the PKC activator PMA and the PKC inhibitor calphostin C had no effect on somatostatin-induced inhibition of endozepine release. The present data demonstrate that somatostatin reduces DBI mRNA level mainly through activation of sst4 receptors negatively coupled to the MAPK pathway  and inhibits endozepine release through activation of sst1  sst2 and sst4 receptors negatively coupled to the adenylyl cyclase/PKA pathway."

Topiramate (TPM)  already used in children to manage newly diagnosed and refractory epilepsy  has potential neuroprotective effects that may be useful in human perinatal brain lesions. In the excitotoxic newborn mouse model  TPM provided dose-dependent and long-lasting protection of developing white matter and cortical plate against S-bromowillardiine. TPM had no significant effect on ibotenate-induced brain lesions. TPM-induced neuroprotection potentially involved increased survival of pre-oligodendrocytes  decreased neuronal apoptosis  inhibition of microglial activation and astrogliosis  and decreased seizure activity.

"605","16000527","Anticonvulsant action of GABA in the high potassium-low magnesium model of ictogenesis in the neonatal rat hippocampus in vivo and in vitro.","Previous developmental studies in vitro suggested that the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA exerts depolarizing and excitatory actions on the immature neurons and that depolarizing GABA is causally linked to ictal activity during the first weeks of postnatal life. However  remarkably little is known on the role of GABA in the generation of neonatal seizures in vivo. Here  using extracellular recordings from CA3 hippocampus  we studied the effects of GABA(A)-acting drugs on electrographic seizures induced by local intrahippocampal injection of the epileptogenic agents (high K(+)/low Mg(2+)) in the nonanesthetized rats in vivo and in the hippocampal slices in vitro during the second postnatal week (postnatal days P8-12). We found that in vivo  the induction of ictal-like events was facilitated by co-infusion of high-K(+)/low Mg(2+) together with the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline or gabazine. Moreover  the infusion of bicuculline alone caused ictal-like activity in approximately 30% of cases. Co-infusion of the GABA(A) receptor agonist isoguvacine or the GABA(A)-positive allosteric modulator diazepam completely prevented high-K(+)/low Mg(2+)-induced seizures. In in vitro studies using hippocampal slices  we also found that high-K(+)/low Mg(2+) produced ictal activity that was exacerbated by bicuculline and gabazine and reduced by isoguvacine. Thus in the model of high-K(+)/low Mg(2+)-induced seizures both in in vivo and in vitro conditions  GABA  acting via GABA(A) receptors  has an anticonvulsant effect during the critical developmental period of enhanced excitability."

When compared to inhibition of in vivo binding of the non-selective ligand [(3)H]Ro 15-1788  the pharmacology of mouse in vivo [(3)H]L-655 708 binding was consistent with selective in vivo labelling of alpha5 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. Thus  diazepam was equipotent at inhibiting in vivo [(3)H]L-655 708 and [(3)H]Ro 15-1788 binding; zolpidem  which has very low affinity for alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors  gave no inhibition of in vivo [(3)H]L-655 708 binding despite inhibiting in vivo [(3)H]Ro 15-1788 binding; and L-655 708 was more potent at inhibiting the in vivo binding of [(3)H]L-655 708 compared to [(3)H]Ro 15-1788. This pharmacological specificity of in vivo [(3)H]L-655 708 binding was confirmed autoradiographically. Hence  the anatomical distribution of in vivo [(3)H]L-655 708 binding was comparable to the distribution of alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors identified in vitro. Moreover  this distribution was distinct from that identified using [(3)H]Ro 15-1788. These data therefore suggest that [(3)H]L-655 708 can be used to identify alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors in vivo and that this ligand can be used to measure receptor occupancy of alpha5-selective ligands."

To study the functions of DBI/ACBP in insect development or diapause  we cloned the cDNA from Helicoverpa armigera (Har) utilizing rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). By homology search  Har-DBI/ACBP is conserved with the DBI/ACBPs known from other insects. Northern blot analysis showed that DBI/ACBP gene expressed in nonneural and neural tissues. RT-PCR combined Southern blot analysis revealed that DBI/ACBP mRNA in the brain of nondiapause individual was much higher than that in the brain of diapausing insects. At early and middle stages of 6th instar larvae  the level of DBI/ACBP mRNA was higher in the midgut of diapause type than that in nondiapause type and low at late 6th instar larval stage and early pupal stage in both types. In the prothoracic gland (PG)  DBI/ACBP expression appeared at a high level at middle and late stages of 6th larval instar in both nondiapause and diapause types  and declined after pupation. In vitro experiments revealed that DBI/ACBP mRNA in PG could be stimulated by synthetic H. armigera diapause hormone (Har-DH)  suggesting that Har-DH may stimulate the PG to produce ecdysteroids by the DBI/ACBP signal pathway. By in vitro assay  we also found that FGIN-1-27  which has similar functions to DBI/ACBP in ecdysteroidogenesis  could induce PG ecdysteroidogenesis effectively  suggesting that DBI/ACBP regulates biosynthesis of ecdysteroids in PG. Thus  DBI/ACBP indeed plays a key role in metabolism and development in H. armigera."

In contrast  in pachytene spermatocytes  TSN is found predominantly in nuclei. Tsn-null males show a reduced sperm count and high levels of apoptosis in meiotic cells  suggesting a critical function for TSN during meiosis. To identify meiotic target RNAs that associate in vivo with TSN  we reversibly cross-linked TSN to RNA in testis extracts from 17-day-old and adult mice and immunoprecipitated the complexes with an affinity-purified TSN antibody. Extracts from Tsn-null mice were used as controls. Cloning and sequencing the immunoprecipitated RNAs  we identified four new TSN target mRNAs  encoding diazepam-binding inhibitor-like 5  arylsulfatase A  a tetratricopeptide repeat structure-containing protein  and ring finger protein 139. In contrast to the population of postmeiotic translationally delayed mRNAs that bind TSN  these four mRNAs are initially expressed in pachytene spermatocytes. In addition  anti-TSN also precipitated a nonprotein-coding RNA (ncRNA)  which is abundant in nuclei of pachytene spermatocytes and has a putative polyadenylation signal  but no open reading frame. A second similar ncRNA is adjacent to a GGA repeat  a motif frequently associated with recombination hot spots.

Intrauterine exposure to ethanol during the last trimester of human gestation can produce a broad spectrum of neuropathologic consequences.

We have previously demonstrated that ethanol-induced neuron apoptosis is critically dependent on expression of Bax  a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. To further define the molecular pathway regulating ethanol-induced neuron apoptosis  we analyzed the effects of acute ethanol exposure on cerebellar internal granule cell neurons both in vivo and in vitro. Ethanol produced extensive Bax-dependent caspase-3 activation and neuron apoptosis in the cerebellar internal granule cell layer  which was maximal at approximately 6 hours postadministration. This effect was recapitulated in vitro and required new gene transcription  protein translation  Bax expression  and caspase activation. Ethanol-induced neuron death was independent of p53 expression and was unaffected by deficiency in the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bid or Bad. These studies indicate that ethanol activates an intrinsic apoptotic death program in neurons that is likely to contribute to the neuropathologic effects of human fetal alcohol exposure."

Sensory input to the OB plays a key role in the survival of newly generated granule cells. Here  we examined in the adult mice whether there is a time window after the generation of new granule cells when their survival is strongly influenced by sensory input. New granule cells were labeled by BrdUrd injection  and the mice were deprived of sensory input unilaterally by naris cauterization. During the initial 14 days after BrdUrd labeling  the number of BrdUrd-positive granule cells was similar for deprived and undeprived OBs. At 28 days or later  the BrdUrd-positive cell number remarkably decreased in the deprived OB. Cauterization at days 14-28 effectively reduced the number of BrdUrd-positive granule cells  whereas 2-week cauterization before or after this period produced little effect. Administration of diazepam  a GABAA receptor modulator  decreased the number of BrdUrd-positive granule cells. The diazepam administration was most effective at days 14-28. Histochemical examination showed that activation of caspase-3 was accompanied by apoptotic cell death of granule cells that was induced by sensory deprivation or diazepam administration. Double labeling with activated caspase-3 and BrdUrd indicated that granule cells at days 14-20 were most susceptible to cell death. These results indicate that there is a critical period when the survival of new granule cells is determined in a sensory experience-dependent manner and that the pharmacological manipulation can mimic the effect of sensory deprivation."

The potency of TG41 was also greater at receptors containing alpha1 or alpha2 subunits than at those containing alpha4 and it was markedly higher at receptors containing beta2 or beta3 subunits than at those containing beta1. This drug induced a reversible loss of the righting reflex in Xenopus tadpoles and it elicited hypnosis (5 mg/kg) after intravenous administration in rats.

No differences were observed in the equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)). The TRalpha2 variant (non-T3-binding) mRNA levels were increased by 33%  whereas no changes in the relative expression of the T3-binding isoforms of TRs (TRalpha1  TRbeta1) were observed.

Seizures are usually caused by complicated etiology and fever and febrile seizure are the commonest causes. Repeated and permanent seizures can damage the brain. So it is important to take active and effective measures to control seizure and high fever. Because most seizures and fever take place at home or out of hospital and it is difficult to administer drugs intravenously  it is important to explore an easy  safe  quick and effective way to control and prevent both seizure and fever. The present study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of rectal administration of mixed ibuprofen and diazepam (IBU-DZP) solution.METHODS: (1) Animal study on the pharmacokinetics in rabbits and pharmacodynamics in rats after rectal administration with the mixed solution and on the irritability of the mixed solution to rectum. (2) Clinical study: Pharmacokinetics of the mixed solution in children after rectal administration were investigated.RESULTS: (1) Animal study: IBU and DZP were both rapidly absorbed from rectum with a peak blood level of (11.7 +/- 1.2) min and (9.4 +/- 2.7) min in rabbits  respectively. The mixed solution could effectively prevent the severity of seizures induced by pentetrazole and significantly suppressed fever induced by yeast. There were no remarkable pathological changes in rectal tissues after repeated rectal administration of the mixed solution. (2) Clinical study: IBU and DZP rapidly reached their peak blood levels at about 30 min and 15 min respectively after rectal administration to the children. The peak values were (57.8 +/- 7.9) mg/L and (450.1 +/- 158.7) microg/L  respectively. In fact  both of them reached levels that were much higher than their therapeutic levels in serum just at 5 min after administration  their blood levels were (41.4 +/- 5.5) mg/L and (321.8 +/- 53.9) microg/L  respectively.CONCLUSIONS: IBU-DZP mixed solution administered rectally is an easy  safe  quick and effective way to control and prevent both seizure and fever."

A minimum consensus for toxicological analysis in this context includes relevant analytes (thiopental  pentobarbital  methohexital  phenobarbital  diazepam  nordazepam  and midazolam) and proposes limits of quantification. Propofol is another relevant drug. After liquid-liquid extraction of 200 microL of plasma using 50 microL of a solution of deuterated internal standards in butyl acetate and 50 microL of butyl acetate  2 microL of the organic phase was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using selected-ion monitoring mode. Validation included the parameters selectivity  calibration model  precision and accuracy  and extraction efficiency. Accuracy and precision data obtained using 6-point and 1-point calibration were compared. The abovementioned analytes were separated within 10 minutes and sensitively detected. No interfering peaks were observed in blank samples from 10 different sources. The linearity ranges were 0.5-6 mg/L for propofol  0.25-10 mg/L for pentobarbital and thiopental  0.125-10 mg/L for methohexital  2.5-50 mg/L for phenobarbital  0.05-2.5 mg/L for diazepam and nordazepam  and 0.01-0.5 mg/L for midazolam. Extraction efficiency ranged from 85% to 111%. The acceptance criterion for accuracy and precision (99% confidence interval of measured mean within +/-50% of target value) was fulfilled for all analytes  even with 1-point calibration using a calibrator close to the center of the linearity range. The assay was applied to analysis of real brain death cases. In conclusion  the described assay allowed fast and reliable determination of analytes relevant to diagnosis of brain death  and 1-point calibration kept the workload low."
"617","15897458","Peptide signaling during terminal differentiation of Dictyostelium.","A wide variety of mechanisms have evolved for intercellular communication in metazoans  but some of the signaling molecules were already used in their predecessors. The social amoeba  Dictyostelium discoideum  is known to use peptides to trigger sporulation within fruiting bodies  but their sequences have not been defined. We found that the peptide signal spore differentiation factor 2 (SDF-2) is processed from acyl-CoA binding protein  AcbA. The mammalian homolog of AcbA is processed to diazepam binding inhibitor that binds to the GABA(A) receptor in the brain and to peripheral 1 4 benzodiazepine receptors. Although Dictyostelium has neither GABA(A) nor peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors  we find that both a diazepam binding inhibitor peptide and diazepam (Valium) can mimic SDF-2 in a Dictyostelium bioassay. Mutants lacking AcbA sporulate well only when developed in chimeras with WT cells. Using a yeast system we show that ligand binding to the SDF-2 receptor histidine kinase  DhkA  inhibits phosphorelay  which can account for its ability to induce rapid sporulation."

"619","15864560","GABAergic dysfunction in schizophrenia: new treatment strategies on the horizon.","RATIONALE: Cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons contribute to the orchestration of pyramidal neuron population firing as follows: (1) by releasing GABA on GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors  (2) by releasing reelin in the proximity of integrin receptors located on cortical pyramidal neuron dendritic spines  and (3) through reelin contributing to the regulation of dendritic spine plasticity by modulating dendritic resident mRNA translation. In schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar (BP) postmortem brains  the downregulation of mRNAs encoding glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD(67)) and reelin decreases the cognate proteins coexpressed in prefrontal cortex (PFC) GABAergic neurons. This finding has been replicated in several laboratories. Such downregulation suggests that the neuropil hypoplasticity found in the PFC of SZ and BP disorder patients may depend on a downregulation of GABAergic function  which is associated with a decrease in reelin secretion from GABAergic neuron axon terminals on dendrites  somata  or axon initial segments of pyramidal neurons. Indirectly  this GABAergic neuron downregulation may play a key role in the expression of positive and negative symptoms of SZ and BP disorders.OBJECTIVES: The above described GABAergic dysfunction may be addressed by pharmacological interventions to treat SZ and BP disorders using specific benzodiazepines (BZs)  which are devoid of intrinsic activity at GABA(A) receptors including alpha(1) subunits but that act as full positive allosteric modulators of GABA action at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2)  alpha(3)  or alpha(5) subunits. These drugs are expected to enhance GABAergic signal transduction without eliciting sedation  amnesia  and tolerance or dependence liabilities.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: BZs  such as diazepam  although they are efficient in equilibrating GABA(A) receptor signal transduction in a manner beneficial in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of SZ  may not be ideal drugs  because by mediating a full positive allosteric modulation of GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha(1) subunit  they contribute to sedation and to the development of tolerance after even a brief period of treatment. In contrast  other BZ-binding site ligands  such as 6-(2bromophenyl)-8-fluoro-4H-imidazo [1 5-a][1 4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxamide (imidazenil)  which fail to allosterically and positively modulate the action of GABA at GABA(A) receptors with alpha(1) subunits but that selectively allosterically modulate cortical GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(5) subunits  contribute to the anxiolytic  antipanic  and anticonvulsant actions of these ligands without producing sedation  amnesia  or tolerance. Strong support for the use of imidazenil in psychosis emerges from experiments with reeler mice or with methionine-treated mice  which express a pronounced reelin and GAD(67) downregulation that is also operative in SZ and BP disorders. In mice that model SZ symptoms  imidazenil increases signal transduction at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(5) subunits and contributes to the reduction of behavioral deficits without producing sedation or tolerance liability. Hence  we suggest that imidazenil may be considered a prototype for a new generation of positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors  which  either alone or in combination with neuroleptics  should be evaluated in GABAergic dysfunction operative in the treatment of SZ and BP disorders with psychosis."

Independent of gender  HAB-M were more anxious than LAB-M animals in a variety of additional tests  including those reflecting risk assessment behaviors and ultrasound vocalization  with unselected CD1 &quot;normal&quot; control (NAB-M) and cross-mated (CM-M) mice displaying intermediate behavioral scores in most cases. Furthermore  in both the forced-swim and tail-suspension tests  LAB-M animals showed lower scores of immobility than did HAB-M and NAB-M animals  indicative of a reduced depression-like behavior. Using proteomic and microarray analyses  glyoxalase-I was identified as a protein marker  which is consistently expressed to a higher extent in LAB-M than in HAB-M mice in several brain areas. The same phenotype-dependent difference was found in red blood cells with NAB-M and CM-M animals showing intermediate expression profiles of glyoxalase-I.

"621","15856082","Novelty seeking and stereotypic activation of behavior in mice with disruption of the Dat1 gene.","Disruption of the dopamine (DA) transporter (Dat1) gene in mice leads to a 50% reduction or complete elimination of Dat1 expression in striatum of respective heterozygous (HZ) and knockout (KO) mice. Compared to wild-type (WT) controls  extracellular DA is increased approximately two- and five-fold in the mutants. Although open field (OF) activity is similar for WT and HZ animals  it is enhanced for KO mice. The purpose of the present investigations was to study spontaneously emitted behaviors and to determine the behavioral and neurochemical mechanisms that may contribute to the hyperactivity of KO animals. Heterozygotes are less anxious than other genotypes and they engage in novelty-seeking behaviors that include increased time spent in the center of the OF  enhanced investigation of objects  and augmented free exploration of a novel environment. By comparison  KO mice display neophobia when initially exposed to novel conditions. Over time the anxiety-like response habituates and behaviors become activated and stereotyped; these responses are unrelated to exploration or novelty seeking. No alterations in extracellular DA levels or tissue contents from several brain regions are detected at the time of stereotypic activation of KO mice. By contrast  this behavior is accompanied by changes in serotonin metabolism in basal ganglia. This feature may contribute to the behavioral inflexibility of KO mice in different experimental contexts. Collectively  these findings suggest that disruption of the Dat1 gene in mice leads to two different phenotypes; one related to anxiety-reducing and novelty seeking  while the other has some homology to disorders with a stereotypical-perseverative spectrum."
"622","15850489","GABAA receptor gamma 2 subunit knockdown mice have enhanced anxiety-like behavior but unaltered hypnotic response to benzodiazepines.","BACKGROUND: Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAA-Rs) are the major inhibitory receptors in the mammalian brain and are modulated by a number of sedative/hypnotic drugs including benzodiazepines and anesthetics. The significance of specific GABAA-Rs subunits with respect to behavior and in vivo drug responses is incompletely understood. The gamma2 subunit is highly expressed throughout the brain. Global gamma2 knockout mice are insensitive to the hypnotic effects of diazepam and die perinatally. Heterozygous gamma2 global knockout mice are viable and have increased anxiety-like behaviors. To further investigate the role of the gamma2 subunit in behavior and whole animal drug action  we used gene targeting to create a novel mouse line with attenuated gamma2 expression  i.e.  gamma2 knockdown mice.RESULTS: Knockdown mice were created by inserting a neomycin resistance cassette into intron 8 of the gamma2 gene. Knockdown mice  on average  showed a 65% reduction of gamma2 subunit mRNA compared to controls; however gamma2 gene expression was highly variable in these mice  ranging from 10-95% of normal. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that gamma2 protein levels were also variably reduced. Pharmacological studies using autoradiography on frozen brain sections demonstrated that binding of the benzodiazepine site ligand Ro15-4513 was decreased in mutant mice compared to controls. Behaviorally  knockdown mice displayed enhanced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus maze and forced novelty exploration tests. Surprisingly  mutant mice had an unaltered response to hypnotic doses of the benzodiazepine site ligands diazepam  midazolam and zolpidem as well as ethanol and pentobarbital. Lastly  we demonstrated that the gamma2 knockdown mouse line can be used to create gamma2 global knockout mice by crossing to a general deleter cre-expressing mouse line.CONCLUSION: We conclude that: 1) insertion of a neomycin resistance gene into intron 8 of the gamma2 gene variably reduced the amount of gamma2  and that 2) attenuated expression of gamma2 increased anxiety-like behaviors but did not lead to differences in the hypnotic response to benzodiazepine site ligands. This suggests that reduced synaptic inhibition can lead to a phenotype of increased anxiety-like behavior. In contrast  normal drug effects can be maintained despite a dramatic reduction in GABAA-R targets."

It was suggested that gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT; gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase) in the brain is responsible for the in vivo formation of this unusual dipeptide. gamma-GT has been prepared by both synthetic and enzymatic methods. The chemical syntheses included the use of protecting groups and coupling methods. A wide spectrum of analytical and spectroscopic methods was used to confirm the structure of the synthetic compounds and to elucidate the position of the peptide bond. Enzymatic preparation of gamma-GT from taurine takes advantage of the selective transpeptidation action of GGT on L-glutamine  glutathione  gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide or other glutamine donors. Although the functional roles of gamma-GT in the brain are only poorly understood  many of its established CNS effects have been reported in the last 25 years. Its effect on emotional arousal and its anti-conflict potencies are synergistic with the anxiolytic drug diazepam. gamma-GT exhibits anti-conflict potency  which is exerted by reducing aversion or phobia and/or the anxiety levels. gamma-GT also acts as endogenous modulator in excitatory aminoacidergic neurotransmission. It is suggested that such acidic peptides through N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors could be part of the neurochemical substrate underlying self-stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex. Other gamma-GT effects in neural systems include: effects on the monoamine concentration in the brain; effects on aggressive behavior in the cat; effects on thyroid hormones in the rat; amelioration of electroshock-induced amnesia; potent and long-lasting antiepileptic action (on intra-amygdaloid injection); affect the glutamatergic system in schizophrenic disorders. Roles for gamma-GT in non-neural systems have also been reported  e.g.  effects on the metamorphosis of amphibians; on plasma rennin regulation; on radiation protection; on uric acid levels; on human antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and many more."

Moreover  the action of diazepam and methyl-6 7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM)  having the opposite effect on GABA(A) receptors  was evaluated on the exploratory behaviour in these mice. Expression levels of GABA(A) receptor subunit genes were also measured.METHODS: Light-dark exploration and fear conditioning tests were used to determine changes in anxiety of mice. The action of diazepam (0.5-2 mg/kg i.p.) and DMCM (0.25-1 mg/kg i.p.) was studied in the light-dark box. The effect of DMCM was also evaluated in the motor activity test to demonstrate that its anti-exploratory action was not related to motor suppression. Expression levels of GABA(A) receptor subunit genes were determined by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).RESULTS: Female mice lacking CCK(2) receptors displayed increased exploratory activity in the light-dark box compared to their wild-type (+/+) littermates. Locomotor activity in the motility boxes and the intensity of freezing did not differ in wild-type (+/+) and homozygous (-/-) mice. Treatment with diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) increased the number of transitions in wild-type (+/+) animals  whereas in homozygous (-/-) mice diazepam (0.5-2 mg/kg) reduced exploratory activity. Administration of DMCM (0.25-1 mg/kg) induced an anxiogenic-like effect in homozygous (-/-) mice  but did not change their locomotor activity. Gene expression analysis established a 1.6-fold increase in the expression of the alpha2 subunit of GABA(A) receptors in the frontal cortex of homozygous (-/-) mice.CONCLUSION: Genetic invalidation of CCK(2) receptors induced an anxiolytic-like action in exploratory  but not in conditioned models of anxiety. The observed reduction in anxiety in homozygous (-/-) mice is probably related to an increased function of GABAergic system in the brain."

After repeated withdrawal experiences  seizure sensitivity increases while withdrawal-induced anxiety and aversion decrease. We used autoradiographical methods employing [(3)H]Ro48 8587  a selective ligand for glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors  to study withdrawal-induced changes in AMPA receptor binding in areas of the mouse brain postulated to be involved in these responses. Mice were given 21 days treatment with diazepam (15 mg/kg  s.c. in sesame oil) followed by withdrawal (single withdrawal) or three blocks of 7 days treatment interspersed with 3-day periods to allow washout of drug (repeated withdrawal). In keeping with heightened excitability in withdrawal from chronic diazepam treatment  the single withdrawal group showed  72 h after their final dose of diazepam  increased [(3)H]Ro48 8587 binding in several brain areas associated with emotional responses or seizure activity  including hippocampal subfields  amygdalar and thalamic nuclei and motor cortex. In contrast  the repeated withdrawal group showed no changes in [(3)H]Ro48 8587 binding in any brain area studied. These observations are consistent with up-regulation of AMPA receptor-mediated transmission being important in withdrawal-induced anxiety and aversion but not in increased seizure sensitivity associated with repeated withdrawal. As changes in AMPA receptor subunit expression alter the functionality of the receptor  future studies will address this possibility."

P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-deficient mice also received [3H]-verapamil to probe the influence of P-gp on uptake/distribution. Mice were sacrificed at selected intervals  and 20 serial 300-microm coronal brain sections were obtained to determine radioactivity. A series of compartmental pharmacokinetic models was developed and fit to concentration vs. time/distance data.RESULTS: After nasal instillation  substrate concentration was highest in the olfactory bulb and decreased with distance. In the absence of transport-mediated flux  peak brain exposure occurred at 6 h. A catenary pharmacokinetic model with slice-specific brain-to-blood efflux rate constants and slice-to-slice diffusivity factors was capable of fitting the data. P-gp limited fractional absorption of [3H]-verapamil via efflux from the nasal cavity and olfactory epithelium. P-gp also increased the rate constants associated with [3H]-verapamil efflux 1.5- to 190-fold  depending on brain region. P-gp limited [3H]-verapamil uptake from the nasal cavity into brain and facilitated removal of [3H]-verapamil from brain during rostral-to-caudal distribution.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together  the data and associated modeling provide a comprehensive assessment of the influence of P-gp on brain uptake and disposition of nasally administered substrates."

We also discuss the functional interaction between DBI and L-type HVCCs in nicotine dependence. Both DBI levels and [(45)Ca(2+)] influx significantly increased in the brain from mice treated with nicotine for long term  which was further enhanced after abrupt cessation of nicotine and was abolished by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonists. Similar responses of DBI expression and L-type HVCC function were observed in cerebral cortical neurons after sustained exposure to nicotine. In addition  increased DBI expression was inhibited by antagonists of nAChR and L-type HVCCs. Sustained exposure of neurons to nicotine significantly enhanced expression of alpha(1) and alpha(2)/delta(1) subunits for L-type HVCCs and caused an increase in the B(max) value of [(3)H]verapamil binding to the particulate fractions. Therefore  it is concluded that the alterations in DBI expression is mediated via increased influx of Ca(2+) through upregulated L-type HVCCs and these neurochemical changes have a close relationship with development of nicotine dependence and/or its withdrawal syndrome."

Valid animal models to study the pathophysiology of depression and specific biological and behavioral responses to antidepressant drug treatments are of prime interest. In order to improve our knowledge of the causal mechanisms of stress-related disorders such as depression  we need animal models that mirror the situation seen in patients. One promising model is the chronic psychosocial stress paradigm in male tree shrews. Coexistence of two males in visual and olfactory contact leads to a stable dominant/subordinate relationship  with the subordinates showing obvious changes in behavioral  neuroendocrine  and central nervous activity that are similar to the signs and symptoms observed during episodes of depression in patients. To discover whether this model  besides its &quot;face validity&quot; for depression  also has &quot;predictive validity &quot; we treated subordinate animals with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine and found a time-dependent recovery of both endocrine function and normal behavior. In contrast  the anxiolytic diazepam was ineffective. Chronic psychosocial stress in male tree shrews significantly decreased hippocampal volume and the proliferation rate of the granule precursor cells in the dentate gyrus. These stress-induced changes can be prevented by treating the animals with clomipramine  tianeptine  or the selective neurokinin receptor antagonist L-760 735. In addition to its apparent face and predictive validity  the tree shrew model also has a &quot;molecular validity&quot; due to the degradation routes of psychotropic compounds and gene sequences of receptors are very similar to those in humans. Although further research is required to validate this model fully  it provides an adequate and interesting non-rodent experimental paradigm for preclinical research on depression."

Unstressed and stressed mice  injected with the vehicle or diazepam  were evaluated in the exploratory behavior test. Diazepam induced clear anxiolytic actions at all doses in unstressed animals  but such an effect was not observed in stressed animals. The injection of allopregnanolone 24 h before the anxiety test blocked the effect of this benzodiazepine. Forced swimming decreased GABA concentrations in the hippocampus and the thalamus-hypothalamus region  besides decreasing the [(3)H]flunitrazepam labeling in both the hypothalamus and amygdala.

Diazepam was also tested as a comparator.RESULTS: MPEP had a significant anxiolytic effect  comparable in magnitude to diazepam  at 10--30 mg/kg in the two conflict and CER tasks. There was no effect of MPEP up to 30 mg/kg on working memory in the DMTP task  but at 100 mg/kg  there was a significant reduction in choice accuracy at the longest delay interval (24 s). MPEP (3--30 mg/kg) did not significantly impair spatial learning in the Morris water maze  although during the last probe trial  30-mg/kg-treated rats were significantly less accurate than controls. In contrast  diazepam significantly impaired performance in both the DMTP and Morris water maze tests. Assessment of plasma and brain concentration of MPEP approximately 75 min following oral administration showed a dose linearity from 3 to 30 mg/kg and good brain penetration  i.e. a brain/plasma ratio of 3.1.CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of the selective mGlu5 receptor antagonist MPEP induces a robust anxiolytic-like effect in rat conflict tests comparable to that seen with diazepam  but in contrast to diazepam  MPEP does not impair working memory or spatial learning at anxiolytic doses."

Extracellular recordings from fish optic tectum revealed ictal and interictal-like electrographic discharges after application of PTZ  which could be blocked by tetrodotoxin or glutamate receptor antagonists. Epileptiform discharges were suppressed by commonly used antiepileptic drugs  valproate and diazepam  in a concentration-dependent manner. Up-regulation of c-fos expression was also observed in CNS structures of zebrafish exposed to PTZ.

The noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) is an important mediator of stress responses and dysfunction of this system is implicated in affective disorders such as anxiety and depression.OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the effects of mGlu5 receptor antagonists  MPEP and 3-[(2-methyl-1 3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (MTEP) on cortical norepinephrine (NE) levels.METHODS: In vivo microdialysis and high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) were used to assess the effects of mGlu5 antagonism on extracellular NE in the frontal cortex  a major terminal field of the LC.RESULTS: Blockade of the mGlu5 receptor elicited significant reductions in extracellular NE in the frontal cortex. The benzodiazepine diazepam also reduced cortical NE. Furthermore  MPEP administration attenuated stress-induced increases in extracellular NE.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together  these data show that MPEP and MTEP  through their blockade of the mGlu5  reduce extracellular norepinephrine  the impact of which may contribute to their anxiolytic actions."
"636","15714479","Participation of dorsal raphe nucleus in the behavioral alteration observed after discontinuation of chronic diazepam administration: possible neural circuitry involved.","Previous findings from our laboratory have demonstrated a positive correlation between the development of tolerance to diazepam (DZ) 5 mg/kg/day over 4 days  and increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity. It seems likely that a similar plastic phenomenon may occur on hippocampal formation after chronic (18 days) DZ administration. We postulate hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) underlying substrate to the behavioral alteration observed after chronic DZ administration. In the present study  we investigated the involvement of the serotonergic (5-HT) system in the possible neural circuitry recruited during DZ withdrawal and in the increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity associated with the discontinuation of chronic DZ administration. The results of the current research demonstrate an increased neuronal activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) during withdrawal. Previous MK-801 administration impairs the development of anxiety signs observed during withdrawal and the concomitant increased electrical activity on 5-HT neurons on DRN. These results are discussed in terms of the participation of 5-HT system in the modulation of hippocampal plasticity developed on DZ withdrawal."

Repeated stress or the use of drugs can modulate stress-induced c-Fos expression. Here  we investigated in 40 different areas of the rat brain the effects of dexamethasone (SDX  a synthetic glucocorticoid)  diazepam (SBDZ  a benzodiazepine)  and imipramine (IMI  an antidepressant) on the c-Fos expression induced by restraint stress. Wistar rats were divided into four groups and submitted to 20 days of daily injection of saline (three first groups) or imipramine  15 mg/kg  i.p. On day 21  animals were submitted to injections of saline (somatosensory  SS)  SDX (1 mg/kg  i.p.)  SBDZ (5 mg/kg  i.p.)  or IMI (15 mg/kg  i.p.) before being submitted to restraint. Immediately after stress  the animals were perfused and their brains processed with immunohistochemistry for c-Fos (Ab-5 Oncogene Science). Dexamethasone reduced stress-induced c-Fos expression in SS cortex  hippocampus  paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH)  and locus coeruleus (LC)  whereas diazepam reduced c-Fos staining in the SS cortex  hippocampus  bed nucleus of stria terminalis  septal area  and hypothalamus (preoptic area and supramammillary nucleus). Chronic administration of imipramine decreased staining in the hippocampus  PVH  and LC  while increasing it in the nucleus raphe pallidus. We conclude that dexamethasone  diazepam and imipramine differentially modulate stress-induced Fos expression. The present study provides an important comparative background that may help in the further understanding of the effects of these compounds and on the brain activation as well as on the behavioral  neuroendocrine  and autonomic responses to stress."

This antidote combination is known to have effects on seizures  respiratory system  blood pressure and animal survival in experiments. However  the inflammatory responses following soman-intoxication leading to neuronal damage have not been fully evaluated. In this paper we focus on the cytokine IL-1beta induction in the rat brain after soman-intoxication (1.0 x LD50 and 1.1 x LD50) and during antidote treatment. We analyzed the IL-1beta levels in rat brain to determine the effects of time of antidote HI 6 and atropine; the effects of different combinations of HI 6 and atropine; and also the effects of antidotes diazepam and atropine following soman-intoxication. We observed that the initiation of the antidote combination of HI 6 and atropine following soman-intoxication was crucial for successful treatment. The study also demonstrated that atropine alone was more effective against IL-1beta up-regulation after soman-intoxication within the 2-h time frame  than the combination of the HI 6 and atropine  the therapy of choice in many countries. Furthermore  treatment with a combination of diazepam and atropine maintained IL-1beta levels at normal when administered at the onset of the seizures following soman exposure. Soman-intoxicated groups without seizures did not have an elevated cytokine level. This corroborates our earlier studies where soman-intoxicated animals with seizures had high levels of IL-1beta  while animals without seizures had normal values. Our results show that both time and the antidote regime are crucial to the success of treatment."

PBR expression in nervous system has been reported in glial and immune cells. We now show expression of both PBR mRNA and protein  and the appearance of binding of a synthetic ligand fluo-FGIN-1-27 in mitochondria of rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). Additionally  the effect of PBR ligands on colchicine-induced apoptosis was investigated. Colchicine-induced neurotoxicity in CGCs was measured at 24 h. We show that  in vitro  PBR ligands 1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195)  7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1 3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1 4- benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro5-4864) and diazepam (25- 50 microM) enhanced apoptosis induced by colchicine  as demonstrated by viability experiments  flow cytometry and nuclear chromatin condensation. Enhancement of colchicine-induced apoptosis was characterized by an increase in mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and AIF proteins and an enhanced activation of caspase-3  suggesting mitochondrion dependent mechanism that is involved in apoptotic process. Our results indicate that exposure of neural cells to PBR ligands generates an amplification of apoptotic process induced by colchicine and that the MPT pore may be involved in this process."

They use the benzodiazepine effect to achieve a more reliable baseline for statistical analysis. The method works only in the MR domain without EEG correlation. It compares the EPI images during interictal epileptic discharges and the images &quot;inactivated&quot; by benzodiazepine. The results in five out of eight patients show that this procedure in comparison with the EEG/fMRI method gives a net improvement of spatial definition of BOLD areas. These preliminary results seem to confirm the hypothesis that the better BOLD/fMRI procedure in epilepsy is to make use of physical features of MR that  unlike EEG  is not influenced by the distance of intercerebral sources and consequently allows a more complete and undistorted display of BOLD areas."

Wistar male rats  which received psychological stress using a communication box for 5 days  were divided into two groups according to the amount of administered diazepam: no diazepam [D (0)] group and 10 mg/kg per day [D (10)] group of 12 rats each. The standardized uptake value (SUV) of (125)I-IMZ of the D (10) group were significantly lower (P &lt; .05) than those of the D (0) group in the frontal  parietal and temporal cortices  globus pallidus  hippocampus  amygdala and hypothalamus. The serum corticosterone level ratio in the D (10) group was significantly lower than that in the D (0) group (P &lt; .05). From the change in serum corticosterone levels  diazepam attenuated the psychological stress produced by the physical stress to animals in adjacent compartments. From the reduced binding of (125)I-IMZ  it is clear that diazepam competed with endogenous ligand for the free BZR sites  and the frontal  parietal and temporal cortices  globus pallidus  hippocampus  amygdala and hypothalamus are important areas in which (125)I-IMZ binding is strongly affected by administration of diazepam."

Like the other benzodiazepine anxiolytics  diazepam does not increase dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. This raises the question as to which other neurotransmitter systems are involved in diazepam dependence. The goal was to monitor dopamine and acetylcholine simultaneously following acute and chronic diazepam treatment and after flumazenil-induced withdrawal. Rats were prepared with microdialysis probes in the nucleus accumbens and given diazepam (2  5 and 7.5 mg/kg) acutely and again after chronic treatment. Accumbens dopamine and acetylcholine decreased  with signs of tolerance to the dopamine effect. When these animals were put into the withdrawal state with flumazenil  there was a significant rise in acetylcholine (145%  P&lt;0.001) with a smaller significant rise in dopamine (124%  P&lt;0.01). It is suggested that the increase in acetylcholine release  relative to dopamine  is a neural component of the withdrawal state that is aversive."
"643","15680179","Seizure-induced oxidative stress in rat brain regions: blockade by nNOS inhibition.","Free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders including epilepsy. Experimental seizures are often accompanied by the generation of free radicals that cause lipid peroxidation (LPO)  which may subsequently cause neurodegeneration observed in certain types of human epilepsy. We recently reported a trigger role for nitric oxide (NO) derived by activation of neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and that the action of conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was potentiated by inhibition of nNOS. In the present study  we extend our observations to understand the significance of blockade of the nNOS pathway on seizure-induced oxidative stress. Increased NO and LPO levels was observed at the time that corresponded to the onset of generalized seizures in rat brain regions following administration of GABA(A) receptor antagonist  picrotoxin (PCT). Treatment with the selective nNOS inhibitor  7-nitroindazole (7-NI)  decreased NO and LPO levels. The AEDs  diazepam and phenobarbitone also prevented seizure-induced increase in NO and LPO levels. Seizures resulted in a significant increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes  superoxide dismutase in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. On the other hand  the activity of glutathione peroxidase was decreased in the hippocampus and midbrain. Whereas treatment with 7-NI could minimize the effects of PCT  the AEDs per se did not have any significant impact on the activity of the antioxidant enzymes  though co-treatment with 7-NI and AEDs could significantly decrease seizure-induced alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities. These observations suggest that the AEDs may not have a significant role in modulating the activities of antioxidant enzymes and that their ability to decrease LPO is realized more likely by their ability to prevent free radical formation. In conclusion  the present study demonstrates that NO contributes to LPO observed following seizures induced by PCT. The study also provides evidence for the ability of the AEDs to inhibit seizure-induced increase in LPO levels  the effect being enhanced by co-treatment with 7-NI suggesting that 7-NI and the AEDs together could prevent the neurotoxic cascade induced by oxidative stress."

Two cell groups were identified: histaminergic tuberomamillary and orexinergic/hypocretinergic neurons. Approximately 25% of histaminergic and 70% of orexinergic neurons contained mRNA encoding for the epsilon-subunit. Double-immunofluorescence staining revealed a somatic localization of this protein in these two neuronal groups. Constitutive activity  diazepam modulation  fast desensitization of maximal currents  and activation by propofol (6-98 microm) of GABA(A)Rs did not correlate with epsilon-subunit expression. Propofol at 3-12 microm potentiated GABA-mediated currents similarly in all neurons. However  noise variance analysis of GABA-mediated currents enhanced by propofol revealed a significant difference between epsilon-positive and epsilon-negative neurons. The former displayed no difference between control and potentiated responses  and  in the latter  noise was decreased in the presence of propofol. Spontaneous IPSCs recorded in cultured hypothalamic neurons were prolonged in the presence of propofol in all epsilon-negative neurons  whereas propofol-resistant IPSCs were recorded in epsilon-positive cells. The infrequent expression of the epsilon-subunit may be a key factor in the recently discovered central role of the tuberomamillary nucleus in anesthesia."

The immunocytochemistry study demonstrated that alpha1  alpha2  beta2/3  and gamma2 subunits formed distinct clusters of various sizes  which were colocalized with clusters of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactivity at rates ranging from 22 to 58%. In contrast  alpha4  beta1  and delta subunits were distributed diffusely over the cell soma and neuronal processes of cultured neurons and did not colocalize with the synaptic marker GAD. Whole-cell GABA receptor currents were moderately sensitive to GABAA and were modulated by diazepam. The whole-cell currents were also enhanced by the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (10 nM). Tonic currents  measured as changes in baseline current and noise  were sensitive to Zn2+  furosemide  and loreclezole; they were insensitive to diazepam. These studies suggest that two kinds of GABAA receptors are expressed on cultured hippocampal neurons. One kind of receptor formed clusters  which were present at GABAergic synapses and in the extrasynaptic membrane. The alpha1  alpha2  beta2/3  and gamma2 subunits were contained in clustered receptors. The second kind was distributed diffusely in the extrasynaptic membrane. The alpha4  beta1  and delta subunits were contained in these diffusely distributed receptors. The properties of tonic currents recorded from these neurons were similar to those from recombinant receptors containing alpha4  beta1  and delta subunits."
"647","15582668","In alcohol-treated rats, naloxone decreases extracellular dopamine and increases acetylcholine in the nucleus accumbens: evidence of opioid withdrawal.","Withdrawal from ethanol is aversive. The question is why. As with the withdrawal from morphine  nicotine  diazepam and sugar  the ethanol withdrawal state may involve an increase in nucleus accumbens (NAc) acetylcholine (ACh) causing an alteration of the dopamine (DA)-ACh balance in favor of ACh. Therefore the effects of acute and chronic alcohol (1 gm/kg/day i.p.) treatment on extracellular concentrations of NAc ACh and DA were determined before and after naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Ethanol initially increased DA to 119% of baseline as measured by microdialysis. This was still the case on the 21st day of ethanol injection when DA increased to 126%. There was no effect of ethanol on ACh. However  naloxone (3 mg/kg s.c.) injected the next day decreased extracellular DA to 83% of baseline and caused a significant rise in ACh to 119%. This state of high ACh combined with low DA may contribute to the aversive aspects of alcohol withdrawal."

Neuroanatomical studies demonstrated that GABA and NPY coexist in neurons of the amygdaloid complex and that NPY may directly modulate the activity of GABAergic neurons by stimulating Y1 receptors. By using a transgenic mouse model harboring a construct comprising the murine Y1 receptor gene promoter fused to a lacZ reporter gene (Y1R/LacZ mice)  we showed that long-term treatment with positive (diazepam or abecarnil) or negative (FG7142) modulators of GABAA receptor function induced a marked increase or decrease  respectively  in Y1 receptor gene expression in the amygdala. Furthermore  we demonstrated that a sustained increase in the brain concentrations of neuroactive steroids  induced by pharmacological treatment or by physiological conditions such as pregnancy  increases Y1 receptor gene expression in the amygdala of Y1R/LacZ transgenic mice  an effect similar to that induced by diazepam or abecarnil. These data provide evidence of a functional interaction between GABAergic and NPY-Y1 mediated transmission and suggest that neuroactive steroids may play an important role in the regulation of the NPY transmission. Finally  our data support a role of Y1 receptors in the behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stress that  however  appears to be independent on the activation of the GABAergic system."
"649","15581395","A GABAergic cortical deficit dominates schizophrenia pathophysiology.","Several lines of evidence support the role of an epigenetic-induced GABAergic cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia psychopathology  which is probably dependent on an increase in the expression of DNA-methyltransferase-1 occurring selectively in GABAergic neurons. The key enzyme regulating GABA synthesis  termed glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) and the important neurodevelopmental protein called reelin are coexpressed in GABAergic neurons. Upon release  GABA and reelin bind to postsynaptic receptors located in dendrites  somata  or the axon initial segment of pyramidal neurons. Because GAD67 and reelin are downregulated in schizophrenia  it is suggested that schizophrenics may express GABAergic deficit-related alterations of pyramidal neuron function. A reduction of dendritic spines is a finding reported in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients. Because dendritic spines are innervated by glutamatergic axon terminals  very probably this reduction of dendritic spine expression is translated into a functional deficit of glutamatergic transmission. Plastic modifications of neuronal circuits are probably dependent on GABAergic transmitter tone  and it is likely that GABAergic dysfunction is at the root of synaptic plasticity deficits in schizophrenia. Thus  a possible avenue for the treatment of schizophrenia would be to address this GABAergic functional deficit using positive allosteric modulators of the action of GABA at GABAA receptors. Benzodiazepines (BZ) such as diazepam are effective in treating positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia  but because they positively modulate GABAA receptors expressing alpha1 subunits  these BZs cause sedation and tolerance. In contrast  imidazenil  a full allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors expressing alpha5 subunits may reduce psychotic symptomatology without producing sedation. Hence  imidazenil should be appropriately studied as a prospective candidate for a pharmacological intervention in schizophrenia."

"651","15549054","Pharmacological and anatomical evidence for an interaction between mGluR5- and GABA(A) alpha1-containing receptors in the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol.","The discriminative stimulus properties of ethanol are mediated in part by positive modulation of GABA(A) receptors. Recent evidence indicates that metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) activity can influence GABA(A) receptor function. Therefore  the purpose of this work was to examine the potential involvement of mGluR5 in the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol. In rats trained to discriminate ethanol (1 g/kg  intragastric gavage (i.g.)) from water  2-methyl-6-(phenylethyl)-pyridine (MPEP) (1-50 mg/kg  i.p.) a selective noncompetitive antagonist of the mGlu5 receptor did not produce ethanol-like stimulus properties. However  pretreatment with MPEP (30 mg/kg) reduced the stimulus properties of ethanol as indicated by significant reductions in ethanol-appropriate responding  specifically at 0.5 and 1 g/kg ethanol  and a failure of ethanol test doses (1 and 2 g/kg) to fully substitute for the ethanol training dose. To test whether mGluR5 antagonism altered the GABA(A) receptor component of the ethanol stimulus  the ability of MPEP to modulate pentobarbital and diazepam substitution for ethanol was assessed. Pentobarbital substitution (1-10 mg/kg  i.p.) for ethanol was not altered by MPEP pretreatment. However  MPEP pretreatment inhibited the ethanol-like stimulus properties of diazepam (5 mg/kg  i.p.). To examine a potential anatomical basis for these pharmacological findings  expression patterns of mGluR5- and benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) alpha1-containing receptors were examined by dual-label fluorescent immunohistochemistry with visualization by confocal microscopy. Results indicated that mGluR5- and GABA(A) alpha1-containing receptors were both coexpressed in limbic brain regions and colocalized on the same cells in specific brain regions including the amygdala  hippocampus  globus pallidus  and ventral pallidum. Together  these findings suggest an interaction between mGluR5- and benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors in mediating ethanol discrimination."
"652","15542765","Pharmacological basis for management of drug dependence.","Neurochemical mechanisms underlying development of drug dependence and withdrawal syndrome remain unclear. Several clinical features of withdrawal syndrome  such as anxiety  are considered to be common among patients with drug dependence induced by different drugs of abuse. In the present study  we investigated whether diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI)  an endogenous anxiogenic neuropeptide  participates in the anxiety associated with drug dependence and its withdrawal symptoms. When we examined brain from mice dependent on alcohol  nicotine  and morphine  we observed that the levels of DBI protein and its mRNA significantly increased. Abrupt cessation of these drugs facilitated further increases in DBI expression. In the cases of nicotine- and morphine-dependent mice  concomitant administration of specific antagonists for nicotinic acetylcholine and m-opioid receptors  respectively  abolished the increased expression. Similar patterns of DBI expression were observed in the neurons after sustained exposure to these drugs and its removal from culture medium. Sustained exposure of the neurons to abused drugs significantly increased the KCl (30 mM)-induced 45Ca2+ influx and enhanced expression of alpha1 subunits for L-type high voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (HVCCs). In addition  the increase in DBI expression was completely blocked by L-type HVCC inhibitors. Therefore  these alterations in DBI expression  mediated via increased influx of Ca2+ through upregulated L-type HVCCs  are closely related to drug dependence and/or its withdrawal syndrome and are considered to be part of a common biochemical process in drug dependence induced by different drugs of abuse."

Whereas there was no evidence of age-related alterations in pharmacokinetics between the 2 groups  the older subjects  in comparison to the young subjects  showed a more delayed choice reaction time in response to the same plasma DZP level  suggesting that hypersensitivity is related to increased age. DZP at 5 mg in the older subjects induced acute and transient hypothermia to the same degree as that induced by DZP at 10 mg in the young subjects. The distal-proximal body temperature gradient (difference between distal body temperature and proximal body temperature)  an indicator of blood flow in distal skin regions  showed strong positive correlation with the delay in choice reaction time in both groups. These findings suggest that hypersensitivity to benzodiazepine in older persons may be due  at least in part  to age-related changes in thermoregulation  especially in the heat loss process."

Inulin  a nonabsorbable marker  was also coperfused in all studies to assess whether the inhibitors altered the physical integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

The brain vascular volume  estimated using inulin  was almost constant (0.94 +/- 0.03 ml.100 g(-1)  n = 12) during the perfusion study. SQV uptake kinetics was linear during the sampling period. Inclusion of 10 muM GF120918 in the perfusate resulted in a more than 7-fold increase in the brain distributional volume (i.e.  uptake) of SQV. Inclusion of 100 muM MK571 in the perfusate increased SQV apparent brain uptake by more than 4.4-fold  suggesting  for the first time  that Mrp transporters may play an important role in the brain uptake and retention of SQV. Neither GF120918 nor MK571 altered the integrity of the BBB during the time course of the study.

Animals withdrawn from chronic diazepam (2 mg/kg/day i.p. for 2 weeks) drank significantly less water than did control rats in the unfamiliar arm of a Y maze. This anxiogenic-like effect could be prevented by acute administration of nifedipine (at 10 mg/kg i.p.  but not at lower doses)  which  on its own  did not change water intake in naive rats. Given chronically in combination with diazepam for the second half of a 2-week treatment with this drug  nifedipine (at the daily dose of 5 mg/kg i.p.) also suppressed the reduction of water intake normally observed on diazepam withdrawal. Biochemical measurements showed that acutely  as well as chronically  administered nifedipine increased 5-HT turnover in the hippocampus of diazepam-treated rats  thereby suggesting that the prevention of diazepam withdrawal-induced anxiogenic behaviour by the calcium antagonist might be underlain by serotoninergic mechanisms."

As generation of these synchronous patterns is assumed to depend on coordinated interneuronal inhibition  we studied the interference of benzodiazepines with the fine structure and occurrence of ripple oscillations. The nonselective GABAA receptor alpha-subunit agonist  diazepam  lowered the frequency of ripple oscillations and reduced their occurrence  amplitude and duration. Zolpidem  an alpha1-subunit selective benzodiazepine elevated ripple duration but acted similar to diazepam in other respects. The nonselective alpha-subunit benzodiazepine antagonist  flumazenil  reduced ripple numbers  amplitude and duration. Wavelet based analysis of the dynamics of intraripple frequency revealed a dramatic decay within a ripple. Only diazepam (1 mg/kg) accelerated this intraripple frequency accommodation. The effects were not due to increased behavioural activity and alertness as evident from vigilance state control. The results suggest a differential role of GABAA receptor subtype specific inhibitory mechanisms in the mediation and fine-tuning of the network synchronization during approximately 200 Hz hippocampal oscillations."
"659","15357317","Comparison of the effects of perfusion in determining brain penetration (brain-to-plasma ratios) of small molecules in rats.","In the process of drug discovery  brain and plasma measurements of new chemical entities in rodents are of interest  particularly when the target receptors are in the brain. Brain-to-plasma ratios (B/P) obtained from a rodent pharmacokinetic assay are useful in helping determine which compounds are brain penetrant. The study reported here was performed to determine whether whole-body saline perfusion for complete blood removal was required to accurately measure brain tissue compound concentrations. Diazepam was used as a positive control since it is highly brain penetrant. Compound A was used as a negative control since it had known poor brain penetration. After intravenous dosing with either diazepam or compound A  rats were anesthetized and blood was collected  then the brain was removed following no perfusion or whole-body perfusion with saline. The analytes described (compound A  diazepam  and the internal standard) were recovered from plasma or brain homogenate by use of protein precipitation  and were subsequently analyzed by use of liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The B/P values determined by use of LC-MS were not significantly different in perfused vs. non-perfused rats (P &gt; or = 0.05). This approach (whole brain collected from non-perfused male rats) is an attractive alternative over brain penetration studies of perfused rats  since it has markedly reduced the technical time and potential for pain and distress required for generating B/P data due to elimination of the requirement for anesthesia and surgical preparation of animals."

GABA (0.1-100 microM) induced Cl- -ATPase activity with the maximum effect at 10 microM. Diazepam (0.1 microM) enhanced the effect of low GABA concentrations (0.1-1 microM) on Cl- -ATPase activity but had no effect on the enzyme in the presence of high GABA concentrations (10-100 microM). At the same time  GABA (1 microM) enhanced the effect of low diazepam concentrations (0.1-1 microM) on the enzyme activity but had no effect on it in the presence of high concentrations of the ligand. Blockers of GABAA-ergic receptors  picrotoxin (50 microM) and bicuculline (5 microM)  canceled the combined effect of diazepam and GABA on the enzyme activity. The obtained data demonstrate that the combined effect of diazepam and GABAA-ergic ligands on Cl- -ATPase activity at physiological pH is similar to the effect of these ligands on GABAA/benzodiazepine/Cl- channel."

BER) using two experimental anxiety models in the mouse. In the black and white test of anxiety  berberine (100  500 mg/kg) produced an increase in the first time entry  time spent in the white section  and total changes between two compartments. On the other hand  in the elevated plus-maze test  berberine (100  500 mg/kg) produced an increase in the time spent and arm entries in the open arms  and a decrease in the time spent and arm entries in the closed arms. Berberine (500 mg/kg) decreased locomotor activity in mice. Furthermore  BER at 100  500 mg/kg decreased concentrations of NE  DA and 5-HT  and increased the concentrations of VMA  HVA and 5-HIAA in the brain stem. BER also attenuated the anxiogenic effect of WAY-100635  8-OH DPAT and DOI and enhanced the anxiolytic effect of BUS  p-MPPI and RIT in the elevated plus-maze. These results suggested that berberine at 100 mg/kg had a significant anxiolytic-like effect  which was similar to that observed with 1 mg/kg diazepam and 2 mg/kg buspirone. The anxiolytic mechanism of BER might be related to the increase in turnover rates of monoamines in the brain stem and decreased serotonergic system activity. Moreover  BER decreased serotonergic system activity via activation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors and inhibition of postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors."
"662","15341600","Functional mapping of GABA A receptor subtypes in the amygdala.","The physiological significance of the large diversity of GABA A receptors is poorly understood. Using mice  which carry a point mutation that renders specific subtypes of GABA A receptors diazepam insensitive  it was recently discovered that particular types of GABA A receptors are involved in specific  behaviorally relevant signaling pathways. We have used these mice to study inhibitory synaptic transmission in the amygdala. GABA A receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) per se were not affected by the point mutations. Their modulation by diazepam  however  was altered depending on the genotype of the mice studied. Based on the different responses to diazepam  we found that IPSCs in the lateral/basolateral amygdala were mediated by both alpha2- and alpha1-subunit-containing GABA A receptors whereas those in the central amygdala were mediated only by alpha2-subunit-containing GABA A receptors. Immunohistochemical staining corroborated these findings at a morphological level. To investigate a possible link between interneuron and receptor diversity  we selectively depressed release from the subset of GABAergic terminals carrying type 1 cannabinoid receptors. These receptors are known to modulate amygdala-mediated behavior. Application of a type 1 cannabinoid receptor agonist resulted in a selective reduction of inhibitory current mediated by alpha1-subunit-containing GABA A receptors. Mice with specific diazepam-insensitive GABA A receptor subtypes therefore provide a novel tool to investigate GABA A receptor distribution and the organization of inhibitory circuits at a functional level. The crucial role of the amygdala for the mediation of anxiety is in agreement with the part that alpha2-subunit-containing GABA A receptors play in anxiolysis and their important function in this area of the brain."
"663","15325386","High trait anxiety and hyporeactivity to stress of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex: a combined phMRI and Fos study in rats.","The neural basis of trait anxiety is poorly understood. In genetically selected hyperanxious (high anxiety-related behavior; HAB) rats  diazepam induces a stronger anxiolytic response than in hypoanxious (low anxiety-related behavior; LAB) rats. A screen for neuronal response differences to diazepam between HAB and LAB rats using pharmacologic fMRI (phMRI) at 7 T revealed a blunted diazepam-induced neuronal deactivation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) of HABs. This was not due to reduced benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor densities in this region. Instead  dmPFC tissue oxygenation at baseline was found to be significantly lower in HABs. This suggests a tonic relative hypoactivity under the highly stressful phMRI conditions  offering an explanation for the reduced responsivity to the neural depressant effect of diazepam in the sense of a floor effect. Subsequently  Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) showed that ethologically relevant stressors also cause less dmPFC activation in HABs. In the context of an anxiety-inhibiting role of the dmPFC  we propose that failure to sufficiently activate this region in stressful situations may contribute to high trait anxiety."

Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI)  an endogenous anxiogenic neuropeptide  significantly increases in brains only after treatment with psychological stress  and this increase is completely abolished by benzodiazepines. Therefore  it is through that DBI may be involved in anxiogenesis produced by psychological stress. Furthermore  increases in cerebral DBI are observed in patients with several disorders accompanying anxiety and fear  which suggest that cerebral DBI may be an essential factor for anxiogenesis  and that it may be  at least in part  a biological index to evalulate anxiety."
"665","15282283","Requirement of alpha5-GABAA receptors for the development of tolerance to the sedative action of diazepam in mice.","Despite its pharmacological relevance  the mechanism of the development of tolerance to the action of benzodiazepines is essentially unknown. The acute sedative action of diazepam is mediated via alpha1-GABA(A) receptors. Therefore  we tested whether chronic activation of these receptors by diazepam is sufficient to induce tolerance to its sedative action. Knock-in mice  in which thealpha1- alpha2- alpha3-  oralpha(5)-GABA(A) receptors had been rendered insensitive to diazepam by histidine-arginine point mutation  were chronically treated with diazepam (8 d; 15 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and tested for motor activity. Wild-type  alpha2(H101R)  and alpha3(H126R) mice showed a robust diminution of the motor-depressant drug action. In contrast  alpha5(H105R) mice failed to display any sedative tolerance. alpha1(H101R) mice showed no alteration of motor activity with chronic diazepam treatment. Autoradiography with [3H]flumazenil revealed no change in benzodiazepine binding sites. However  a decrease in alpha5-subunit radioligand binding was detected selectively in the dentate gyrus with specific ligands. This alteration was observed only in diazepam-tolerant animals  indicating that the manifestation of tolerance to the sedative action of diazepam is associated with a downregulation of alpha5-GABA(A) receptors in the dentate gyrus. Thus  the chronic activation of alpha(5)-GABA(A) receptors is crucial for the normal development of sedative tolerance to diazepam  which manifests itself in conjunction with alpha1-GABA(A) receptors."

Given the recent discovery of a selective and brain penetrable mGlu5 receptor antagonists  the effect of 3-[(2-methyl-1 3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]-pyridine (MTEP)  i.e. the most potent mGlu5 antagonist  was evaluated in established models of anxiety after single or repeated administration. We also studied if the anxiolytic effect of MTEP is mediated by mechanism involving the GABA-benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor complex. Experiments were performed on male Wistar rats or male Albino Swiss mice. The anxiolytic-like effects of MTEP were tested in the conflict drinking test and the elevated plus-maze test in rats as well as in the four-plate test in mice. MTEP (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) induced anxiolytic-like effects in the conflict drinking test (after single and repeated administration) and in the elevated plus-maze test in rats. In the four-plate test in mice  it exerted anxiolytic activity at a dose of 20 mg/kg. MTEP had no effect on the locomotor activity of animals. The anxiolytic-like effect of MTEP was not changed by BZD antagonist flumazenil. Moreover  a synergistic interaction between non-effective doses of MTEP and diazepam was observed in the conflict drinking test. These data suggest that selective mGlu5 receptor antagonists mediated anxiolysis is not dependent on GABA-ergic system and that these agents may play a role in the therapy of anxiety."
"667","15254090","Variability in the benzodiazepine response of serotonin 5-HT1A receptor null mice displaying anxiety-like phenotype: evidence for genetic modifiers in the 5-HT-mediated regulation of GABA(A) receptors.","Benzodiazepines (BZs) acting as modulators of GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are an important group of drugs for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However  a large inter-individual variation in BZ sensitivity occurs in the human population with some anxiety disorder patients exhibiting diminished sensitivity to BZ and reduced density of GABA(A)Rs. The mechanism underlying BZ treatment resistance is not known  and it is not possible to predict whether an anxiety patient will respond to BZ. 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor (5-HT1AR) null mice (R-/-) on the Swiss-Webster (SW) background reproduce several features of BZ-resistant anxiety; they exhibit anxiety-related behaviors  do not respond to BZ  have reduced BZ binding  and have decreased expression of the major GABA(A)R subunits alpha1 and alpha2. Here  we show that R-/- mice on the C57Bl6 (B6) background also have anxiety phenotype  but they respond to BZ and have normal GABA(A)R subunit expression. This indicates that the 5-HT1AR-mediated regulation of GABA(A)R alpha subunit expression is subject to genetic modification. Hybrid SW/B6-R-/- mice also exhibit BZ-resistant anxiety  suggesting that SW mice carry a genetic modifier  which mediates the effect of the 5-HT1AR on the expression of GABA(A)Ralpha subunits. In addition  we show that this genetic interaction in SW mice operates early in postnatal life to influence the expression of GABA(A)R alpha subunits at the transcriptional level. These data indicate that BZ-resistant anxiety results from a developmental arrest of GABA(A)R expression in SW-R-/- mice  and a similar mechanism may be responsible for the BZ insensitivity of some anxiety patients."

Varying doses of diazepam (1-3 mg/kg) or ethanol (0.5-2.0 g/kg) were tested using both the elevated plus maze and defensive prod-burying models. Two time points following ethanol administration (10 and 30 min) were tested in the plus maze. Sex differences were seen in some anxiety-related behaviors  with females showing greater open arm time and reduced burying behavior than males. Although this suggests females displayed less anxiety-like behavior than males  the differences in the plus maze were not observed in all testing situations. Both diazepam and ethanol dose-dependently increased open arm times in the plus maze and reduced burying behavior in the defensive prod-burying task. The parallel nature of the dose-response curves suggests that both diazepam and ethanol have similar anxiolytic effects in males and females. No sex differences were seen in the brain levels of diazepam-like activity or blood alcohol levels with these treatments. A greater corticosterone response was observed in females than males with these two behavioral tests  but neither diazepam nor ethanol decreased this response. These results suggest a dissociation between the anxiety-reducing influences of these compounds and the changes in stress-related endocrine responses."

AC-5216 showed high affinity for MBRs prepared from rat whole brain (Ki 0.297 nm)  rat glioma cells (IC50 3.04 nm) and human glioma cells (IC50 2.73 nm)  but only negligible affinity for the other main receptors including central benzodiazepine receptors.

These effects of AC-5216 were antagonized by PK11195  an MBR antagonist. In the forced swimming test in rats  AC-5216 (3-30 mg kg(-1)  p.o.) reduced the immobility time  and this effect was blocked by PK11195. AC-5216 had no myorelaxant effects  did not affect the memory or prolong hexobarbitone-induced sleep in mice  even at doses as high as 1000 mg kg(-1)  p.o. Although it did slightly prolong the ethanol-induced sleep time at 1000 mg kg(-1)  AC-5216 (1-100 mg kg(-1)  p.o.) produced no distinct change in the rat electroencephalogram. These results indicate that AC-5216 produces anti-anxiety and antidepressant-like effects that are mediated by MBR  but does not cause the side effects normally associated with conventional benzodiazepines. Hence  AC-5216 shows potential for the treatment of stress-related disorders including anxiety and depression."
"670","15245495","Does amygdaloid corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mediate anxiety-like behaviors? Dissociation of anxiogenic effects and CRH release.","The brain corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) circuits are activated by stressful stimuli  contributing to behavioral and emotional responses. The present study assessed anxiety-like responses and in vivo neurochemical alterations at the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) evoked by exposure to an unfamiliar (anxiogenic) environment. Also  the impact of anxiolytic treatments and those that affect CRH were assessed in this paradigm. Novel environment (new cage) markedly suppressed ingestion of a palatable snack. This effect was dose-dependently antagonized by diazepam and was utilized as an index of anxiety in the rodent. Although exposure to a novel environment also stimulated the in vivo release of CRH and glutamate at the CeA  various CRH antagonists (e.g. alphah-CRH  Calpha-MeCRH  CP-154 526  antisauvagine-30  preproTRH178-199) did not attenuate the stressor-elicited behavioral suppression  although Calpha-MeCRH was found to attenuate the freezing response elicited by contextual stimuli that were associated with previously administered footshock. Moreover  central infusion of CRH failed to suppress snack consumption in the home cage. Although diazepam had potent anxiolytic effects in this paradigm  this treatment did not prevent the stressor-associated release of CRH and glutamate at the CeA. Thus  while neural circuits involving CRH and/or glutamatergic receptors at the CeA may be activated by an unfamiliar environment  the data challenge the view that activation of these receptors is necessary for the expression of anxiety-like behavioral responses. Rather than provoking anxiety  these systems might serve to draw attention to events or cues of biological significance  including those posing a threat to survival."

In this study  we evaluated (18)F-FDG uptake in BAT of rats to determine whether pharmacologic or physiologic interventions affect the uptake  knowing that BAT has a high density of adrenergic innervation.METHODS: Seven- to 8-wk-old female Lewis rats receiving intravenous (18)F-FDG injections were examined under various conditions to evaluate (18)F-FDG biodistribution into interscapular BAT and major organs. In series 1  rats were given ketamine-based anesthesia or were exposed to cold (4 degrees C for 4 h) to determine whether these interventions increased (18)F-FDG uptake in BAT. In series 2  anesthetized rats (ketamine-based anesthesia) were given propranolol  reserpine  or diazepam intraperitoneally before (18)F-FDG injection to determine whether the drug reduced (18)F-FDG uptake in BAT. The control and treated groups in series 2 were also evaluated with (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging.RESULTS: In series 1  anesthesia or exposure to cold increased (18)F-FDG uptake in BAT to levels 14-fold and 4.9-fold  respectively  greater than the control nonstimulated values. BAT uptake was high  comparable to that in the brain. In series 2  (18)F-FDG uptake in BAT was significantly decreased to less than 30% of the control level after propranolol or reserpine (P &lt; 0.05). Diazepam did not significantly decrease (18)F-FDG uptake in BAT. (18)F-FDG PET/CT findings reflected these biodistribution data: The control and diazepam groups exhibited intense (18)F-FDG uptake in BAT  whereas the propranolol and reserpine groups showed only faint to mild (18)F-FDG uptake in BAT. Among several organs whose (18)F-FDG uptake was affected after predosing drugs  the heart exhibited considerable decreases in tracer uptake with propranolol or reserpine.CONCLUSION: This rodent study demonstrated that BAT can exhibit high (18)F-FDG uptake under stimulated conditions including exposure to cold and that propranolol or reserpine treatment can remarkably reduce the high (18)F-FDG uptake in BAT. The effect of these drugs on (18)F-FDG uptake in human BAT  as well as on tracer accumulation in other organs  should carefully be evaluated clinically to minimize the USA-Fat artifact."

After chemical synthesis  hispidulin was investigated at recombinant GABA(A)/BZD receptors expressed by Xenopus laevis oocytes. Concentrations of 50 nm and higher stimulated the GABA-induced chloride currents at tested receptor subtypes (alpha(1-3 5 6)beta(2)gamma(2)S) indicating positive allosteric properties. Maximal stimulation at alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2)S was observed with 10 microm hispidulin. In contrast to diazepam  hispidulin modulated the alpha(6)beta(2)gamma(2)S-GABA(A) receptor subtype. When fed to seizure-prone Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) in a model of epilepsy  hispidulin (10 mg kg(-1) body weight (BW) per day) and diazepam (2 mg kg(-1) BW per day) markedly reduced the number of animals suffering from seizures after 7 days of treatment (30 and 25% of animals in the respective treatment groups  vs 80% in the vehicle group). Permeability across the blood-brain barrier for the chemically synthesized  (14)C-labelled hispidulin was confirmed by a rat in situ perfusion model. With an uptake rate (K(in)) of 1.14 ml min(-1) g(-1)  measurements approached the values obtained with highly penetrating compounds such as diazepam. Experiments with Caco-2 cells predict that orally administered hispidulin enters circulation in its intact form.

"673","15219633","Impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system is related to severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal in patients with depression.","A concatenation of data indicates that the pathogenesis of depression is related to an increased production and secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Benzodiazepines profoundly suppress the basal and stress-related activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system and discontinuation of these drugs results in rebound activation. We therefore investigated whether the extent of HPA system dysregulation is related to the severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal in patients with depression. We performed the combined dexamethasone/CRH test before benzodiazepine discontinuation (taper-off max. 5 mg diazepam-equivalents/week) in 14 depressed patients (13 f  1 m  mean age 54.6 +/- 14.6) who responded to the antidepressant treatment. The severity of withdrawal symptoms was measured using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment-Benzodiazepines (CIWA-B) questionnaire. The depressive psychopathology was monitored using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale  Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Patients with more severe benzodiazepine withdrawal (CIWA-B-increase &gt; 14 pts; n = 7) showed a significant higher cortisol and ACTH response in the dexamethasone/CRH test preceding the discontinuation of benzodiazepines than patients displaying less severe withdrawal symptoms (CIWA-B-increase &lt;14 pts.; n = 7) (ANCOVA  p &lt; 0.05). Both groups did not differ in the pre-taper psychopathology ratings and their basal neuroendocrine activity. In view of the GABAergic inhibition of HPA system activity and the anxiogenic effect of CRH  benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms may be partly due to a disinhibition of the HPA system during discontinuation of benzodiazepines."

It failed to potentiate Cl(-) currents induced by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) both in Xenopus oocytes expressing recombinant human GABA(A) receptors and in cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal cells  but it inhibited the ability of diazepam to potentiate the effect of GABA in these systems. Miltirone (1-10 microM) also partially inhibited the increase in the abundance of the mRNA for the alpha(4) subunit of the GABA(A) receptor induced by ethanol withdrawal in cultured hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that miltirone might ameliorate the symptoms associated with discontinuation of long-term administration of ethanol or of other positive modulators of the GABA(A) receptor."

Patch-clamp  whole-cell recordings were compared from neurons acutely dissociated from the nucleus reticularis of thalamus (nRt) treated and untreated with a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor  U18666A. In U18666A-treated animals  91% of rats developed EEG spike-waves (SWs). Patchclamp results revealed that although there was no remarkable change in GABAA receptor affinity  both a loss of ability of benzodiazepines to enhance GABAA-receptor responses and an increase of Zn2+ inhibition of GABAA-receptor responses of nRt neurons occurred in Long-Evans Hooded rats previously administered U18666A. This change was specific  since no significant changes were found in neurons exposed to the GABA allosteric modulator  pentobarbital. Taken collectively  these findings provide evidence for abnormalities in benzodiazepine and Zn2+ modulation of GABAA receptors in the CSI model  and suggest that decreased gamma2 subunit expression may underlie important aspects of generation of thalamocortical SWs in atypical absence seizures. The present results are also consistent with recent findings that mutation of the gamma2 subunit of the GABAA receptor changes benzodiazepine modulation in families with generalized epilepsy syndromes."

It is well documented that anxiolytic drugs diminish septo-hippocampal oscillatory Theta activity contributing to their either therapeutic or unwanted side effects. In the present experiments we applied a combination of computational and physiological techniques to explore the functional role of GABAA receptors in Theta oscillation. In electrophysiological experiments extracellular single unit recordings were performed from medial septum/diagonal band of Broca with simultaneous hippocampal (CA1) electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from anesthetized rats. Neurotransmission at GABAA receptors were modulated by means of pharmacological tools: the actions of the GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator diazepam and inverse agonist/negative allosteric modulator FG-7142 were evaluated on septo-hippocampal activity. Systemic administration of diazepam inhibited  whereas FG-7142 enhanced Theta oscillation of septal neurons and hippocampal EEG Theta activity. In parallel to these experimental observations  a computational model has been constructed by implementing a septal GABA neuron model with a CA1 hippocampal model containing three types of neurons (including oriens and basket interneurons and pyramidal cells; latter modeled by multicompartmental techniques; for detailed model description with network parameters see online addendum: http://geza.kzoo.edu/theta). This connectivity made the network capable of simulating the responses of the septo-hippocampal circuitry to the modulation of GABAA transmission  and the presently described computational model proved suitable to reveal several aspects of pharmacological modulation of GABAA receptors.

The derivative NSC 655649 (diethylaminoethyl analog of rebeccamycin  or DEAE rebeccamycin) is currently undergoing early-phase human studies and has shown some signs of antitumor activity. We studied the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pharmacokinetics of NSC 655649 after systemic administration in a nonhuman primate model that is predictive of anticancer drug behavior in humans.DESIGN: A dose of 400 mg/m2 was infused over 1 h to three rhesus monkeys. Serial blood and CSF samples were collected. Rebeccamycin concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using compartmental and noncompartmental methods.RESULTS: A two-compartment or three-compartment model described rebeccamycin pharmacokinetics in plasma adequately. In two animals  the three-compartment model provided a better fit  and in one animal  the two-compartment model was better. The terminal half-life was 730+/-410 min  the AUC was 3130+/-425 microM min  and the clearance was 190+/-25 ml/min/m2. Rebeccamycin was below the limit of quantitation in all CSF samples. The animals had some nausea and agitation during and shortly after the infusion that responded to treatment with prochlorperazine or diazepam. Otherwise  rebeccamycin was well tolerated with minimal toxicity.CONCLUSION: Rebeccamycin penetrates poorly into the CSF following an intravenous infusion. Therefore  systemically administered rebeccamycin is unlikely to be an important agent for the treatment of leptomeningeal tumors. Because the drug is associated with local irritation at injection sites  it is not an ideal candidate for development as an intrathecal agent. However  the role of rebeccamycin in the treatment of parenchymal brain tumors should be determined in clinical trials."

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone  TRH  which has a chemical structure similar to nootropics increases cerebellar uptake of glucose in murine rolling ataxia. This paper shows that nootropic drugs like piracetam (2-oxo 1 pyrrolidine acetamide) and levetiracetam and neuropeptides like TRH antagonise the inhibition of glucose transport by barbiturates  diazepam  melatonin and endogenous neuropeptide galanin in human erythrocytes in vitro. 2 The potencies of nootropic drugs in opposing scopolamine-induced memory loss correlate with their potencies in antagonising pentobarbital inhibition of erythrocyte glucose transport in vitro (P&lt;0.01). Less potent nootropics  D-levetiracetam and D-pyroglutamate  have higher antagonist Ki's against pentobarbital inhibition of glucose transport than more potent L-stereoisomers (P&lt;0.001). 3 Piracetam and TRH have no direct effects on net glucose transport  but competitively antagonise hypnotic drug inhibition of glucose transport. Other nootropics  like aniracetam and levetiracetam  while antagonising pentobarbital action  also inhibit glucose transport. Analeptics like bemigride and methamphetamine are more potent inhibitors of glucose transport than antagonists of hypnotic action on glucose transport. 4 There are similarities between amino-acid sequences in human glucose transport protein isoform 1 (GLUT1) and the benzodiazepine-binding domains of GABAA (gamma amino butyric acid) receptor subunits. Mapped on a 3D template of GLUT1  these homologies suggest that the site of diazepam and piracetam interaction is a pocket outside the central hydrophilic pore region. 5 Nootropic pyrrolidone antagonism of hypnotic drug inhibition of glucose transport in vitro may be an analogue of TRH antagonism of galanin-induced narcosis."

An increase in intracellular Ca2+ is well established  but there are few studies of changes in intracellular Cl- ([Cl-]i) after ischemia. We used an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation) to examine changes in [Cl-]i and GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses in hippocampal slices from adult rats. Changes in [Cl-]i were measured in area CA1 pyramidal neurons using optical imaging of 6-methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium chloride  a Cl--sensitive fluorescent indicator. Oxygen-glucose deprivation induced an immediate rise in [Cl-]i  which recovered within 20 min. A second and more prolonged rise in [Cl-]i occurred within the next hour  during which postsynaptic field potentials failed to recover. The sustained increase in [Cl-]i was not blocked by GABA(A) receptor antagonists. However  oxygen-glucose deprivation caused a progressive downregulation of the K+-Cl- cotransporter (KCC2)  which may have contributed to the Cl- accumulation. The rise in [Cl-]i was accompanied by an inability of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol to cause Cl- influx. In vivo  diazepam is neuroprotective when given early after ischemia  although the mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood. Here  we added diazepam early after oxygen-glucose deprivation and prevented the downregulation of KCC2 and the accumulation of [Cl-]i. Consequently  both GABA(A) responses and synaptic transmission within the hippocampus were restored. Thus  after oxygen-glucose deprivation  diazepam may decrease neuronal excitability  thereby reducing the energy demands of the neuron. This may prevent the activation of downstream cell death mechanisms and restore Cl- homeostasis and neuronal function"

Animals received unilateral intra-amygdaloid injection of kainic acid (0.5 microg) to induce seizures for 1 h. The seizures were then terminated by diazepam (30 mg/kg). Animals were killed 0  2  4  8  24 or 72 h following diazepam administration. The apoptotic and surviving neurons in hippocampus were observed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and cresyl violet staining  the expression of Smac/DIABLO  XIAP and caspase-9 was detected with immunofluorescence and western blot. The results showed that the levels of XIAP and the 46-kDa proenzyme form of caspase-9 were unaffected by the seizures. The expression of Smac increased at 2 h and the 37-kD cleaved fragment of caspase-9 was detected at 4 h  TUNEL-positive neurons appeared at 8 h and reached maximal at 24 h following seizure cessation within the ipsilateral (the same side as the intra-amygdaloid injection of kainic acid) CA3 subfield of the hippocampus. Intracerebroventricular infusion of caspase-9 inhibitor z-LEHD-fluoromethyl ketone (z-LEHD-fmk) significantly decreased TUNEL-positive neurons and increased the number of surviving cells. Caspase-9 immunoreactivity increased and Smac/DIABLO  XIAP immunoreactivity became extensive within the ipsilateral CA3 neurons. TUNEL-positive neurons and the alterations of the expression of Smac/DIABLO and XIAP within the ipsilateral CA3 were not detected within the contralateral hippocampus. These results suggest that seizures lead the translocation of Smac/DIABLO into the cytosol  the activation of caspase-9 and the change of subcellular locoalization of XIAP. These changes may play a role in the brain damage induced by seizures. Caspase-9 is possibly a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of brain injury associated with seizures."
"681","15126642","Altered pharmacology of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors on CA1 hippocampal neurons is consistent with subunit changes in a model of alcohol withdrawal and dependence.","Previously  we reported (Cagetti  Liang  Spigelman  and Olsen  2003) that chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) treatment leads to signs of alcohol dependence  including anxiety and hyperactivity  accompanied by reduced synaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (A) receptor (GABAAR) function and altered sensitivity to its allosteric modulators consistent with a measured switch in subunit composition. In this study  we separated the synaptic and extrasynaptic components of GABAAR activation in recordings from pyramidal CA1 cells of hippocampal slices and demonstrated marked differences in the responsiveness of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs to agonists and allosteric modulators in control rats  and in the way they are altered following CIE treatment. Notably  tonic inhibition mediated by extrasynaptic GABAARs was differentially sensitive to the partial agonist gaboxadol (4 5 6 7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5 4-c]pyridin-3-ol; THIP) and the allosteric modulator zolpidem  compared with the miniature inhibitory synaptic currents (mIPSCs) in the same cells from saline-treated rats. After CIE treatment  potentiation of tonic currents by diazepam and zolpidem was lost  whereas potentiation by the alpha4 subunit-preferring benzodiazepine Ro15-4513 (ethyl 8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1 5-a]-[1 4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) and THIP was only partially reduced. Potentiation of synaptic GABAAR currents by zolpidem was eliminated after CIE  whereas THIP slightly inhibited mIPSCs from control rats and greatly enhanced them after CIE treatment. These results are consistent with alpha1 subunit decreases at synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs  whereas alpha4 subunits are increased at synaptic and decreased at extrasynaptic GABAARs. Behaviorally  THIP was active as a hypnotic and anxiolytic but not as an anti-convulsant against pentylenetetrazol seizures in control rats. Only slight tolerance was observed to the sleep time  but not to the anxiolytic  effect of THIP after CIE. Thus  differential alterations in synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs appear to play an important role in the brain plasticity of alcohol dependence  and withdrawal signs may be profitably treated with GABAergic drugs such as THIP  which does not show cross-tolerance with ethanol."

Animal studies have clearly demonstrated sedative efficacy for these compounds in acute studies. However  relatively less is known regarding their efficacy under brief periods of repeat administration or following intermittent dosing. Therefore zolpidem  a short-acting GABAAR modulator with selectivity for the type-I (omega1) benzodiazepine receptor  was studied for efficacy in altering rat sleep architecture as determined by electrocorticogram (ECoG) and electromyogram (EMG) activity over a 7-day sub-chronic administration period. Zolpidem caused significant reductions in wakefulness entries and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep entries and duration  with increases in Delta sleep duration throughout the administration period. Examination of sleep architecture 24 h after cessation of sub-chronic zolpidem administration revealed a decrease in Delta sleep  suggesting that repeated zolpidem administration might elicit enduring modifications to sleep organization. This was not seen following similar dosing of diazepam. The efficacy of sub-chronic administration of zolpidem to alter sleep architecture was enhanced when the administration regimen was repeated following a 7-day hiatus. Significant increases in Delta sleep duration  with significant decreases in light sleep and wakefulness were observed during the repeated exposure to zolpidem. Therefore  sub-chronic administration of zolpidem affected lasting modifications in sleep organization that appeared both 1 day following administration and during reiterated administration without eliciting tolerance."
"683","15102341","Pathogenesis of peroxisomal deficiency disorders (Zellweger syndrome) may be mediated by misregulation of the GABAergic system via the diazepam binding inhibitor.","BACKGROUND: Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is a fatal inherited disease caused by peroxisome biogenesis deficiency. Patients are characterized by multiple disturbances of lipid metabolism  profound hypotonia and neonatal seizures  and distinct craniofacial malformations. Median live expectancy of ZS patients is less than one year. While the molecular basis of peroxisome biogenesis and metabolism is known in considerable detail  it is unclear how peroxisome deficiency leads to the most severe neurological symptoms. Recent analysis of ZS mouse models has all but invalidated previous hypotheses.HYPOTHESIS: We suggest that a regulatory rather than a metabolic defect is responsible for the drastic impairment of brain function in ZS patients.TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: Using microarray analysis we identify diazepam binding inhibitor/acyl-CoA binding protein (DBI) as a candidate protein that might be involved in the pathogenic mechanism of ZS. DBI has a dual role as a neuropeptide antagonist of GABA(A) receptor signaling in the brain and as a regulator of lipid metabolism. Repression of DBI in ZS patients could result in an overactivation of GABAergic signaling  thus eventually leading to the characteristic hypotonia and seizures. The most important argument for a misregulation of GABA(A) in ZS is  however  provided by the striking similarity between ZS and &quot;benzodiazepine embryofetopathy&quot;  a malformation syndrome observed after the abuse of GABA(A) agonists during pregnancy.IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: We present a tentative mechanistic model of the effect of DBI misregulation on neuronal function that could explain some of the aspects of the pathology of Zellweger syndrome."
"684","15100702","Role of neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone in antipsychotic-like action of olanzapine in rodents.","Olanzapine increases brain allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels sufficiently to modulate neuronal activity by allosterically regulating GABAA receptors. Recently  we reported the antipsychotic-like profile of ALLO in rodents. The present study examined the hypothesis that olanzapine-induced elevation of endogenous neurosteroid ALLO is vital for its neuroleptic-like action. The conditioned avoidance response (CAR) and apomorphine-induced climbing behavioral paradigms were used in rodents. Administration of ALLO (1 microg  intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)) or neurosteroidogenic agents such as the mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor receptor agonist  FGIN 1-27 (0.5 microg  i.c.v.) or the ALLO precursor  progesterone (10 mg/kg  i.p.) significantly potentiated olanzapine-induced blockade of CAR and apomorphine-induced climbing. In contrast  these agents failed to alter the antipsychotic-like effect of risperidone and haloperidol. On the other hand  inhibition of the endogenous biosynthesis of neurosteroids by the 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor  trilostane (30 mg/kg  i.p.)  the 3alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase inhibitor  indomethacin (5 mg/kg  i.p.)  or the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (1 mg/kg  i.p.) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (1 mg/kg  i.p.) blocked the effect of olanzapine  but not of risperidone and haloperidol. Socially isolated animals  known to exhibit decreased brain ALLO and GABAA receptor functions  displayed a shortening in the muscimol-induced loss of righting reflex and an increased susceptibility to apomorphine-induced climbing. Administration of olanzapine  but not of haloperidol and risperidone  normalized the duration of muscimol-elicited loss of righting reflex. Although all three antipsychotics proved capable of antagonizing the apomorphine-induced climbing  a dose almost five times higher of olanzapine was required in socially isolated animals. The data obtained suggest that enhancement of the GABAergic tone plays a key role in the antipsychotic-like effect exerted by olanzapine in rodents  likely as a consequence of augmented levels of neuroactive steroids  in particular ALLO  in the brain. The present findings provide the first specific behavioral evidence in support of the hypothesis that neuroactive steroid ALLO- mediated GABAergic modulation is essential for the antipsychotic-like action of olanzapine."

Physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) in combination with procyclidine doses of 1  3  or 6 mg/kg effectively prevented the development of convulsions and hippocampally monitored seizures when the doses of soman were 1.3  1.6  or 2 x LD50  respectively. Results from [(3)H]MK-801-binding experiments showed that procyclidine inhibits the phencyclidine site at the NMDA receptor in a concentration-dependent manner. Physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) and procyclidine in a dose of 1 mg/kg did not prevent convulsions or seizures when the soman dose was 1.6 x LD50. Subsequent treatment with scopolamine in doses of 0.5 or 1 mg/kg immediately after (3 min) seizure onset showed that only the highest dose produced a reliable termination. When scopolamine (1 mg/kg) was given later (10 min) after onset of seizures  no effect was obtained. The sustained seizures were subsequently treated with diazepam (10 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) and finally terminated 25 min after onset. In rats given inadequate prophylaxis  both modified convulsions and seizures were seen. It is suggested that moderate doses of prophylactics should be preferred to avoid adverse effects on cognitive functions because insufficient prophylaxis can be compensated for by adjunct treatment."

Long-term exposure to NMDA increased DBI mRNA expression  and NO synthase inhibitors dose-dependently inhibited this increase. DETA NONOate dose-dependently increased DBI mRNA expression when exposing the neurons to this agent for 3 days and a maximal enhancement of the expression was found at 100 microM of the NO generator. In addition  a significant increase in DBI mRNA expression was observed 1 day after the exposure to 100 microM DETA NONOate  and the maximal expression was observed 2 days after the exposure  whereas transient exposure for less than 3 h to 100 microM DETA NONOate produced no changes in the expression. DETA NONOate (100 microM)-induced increase in DBI mRNA expression was completely abolished by concomitant exposure to hemoglobin. DBI content was also dose-dependently increased by DETA NONOate after the exposure for 3 days. The inhibition of cGMP formation by 1H-[1 2 4] oxadiazolo [4 3-alpha]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) showed no affects on the DETA NONOate-induced expression  suggesting that the increased expression of DBI mRNA is mediated via processes independent of cGMP. These results indicate that continuous exposure of the neurons to NO is an essential factor for increasing DBI mRNA expression in the neurons."

MK-801  a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor  impairs both the development of conditioned tolerance to diazepam and the hippocampal long-term potentiation generation. In the present study  we have further investigated the hippocampal glutamatergic transmission in the development of tolerance to diazepam. Our results demonstrate that the development of tolerance to the hypolocomotive effect of diazepam  along with the increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity and the associated over expression of the mRNA NR1 and NR2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits  were blocked by previous MK-801 administration. We suggest that the participation of hippocampal glutamatergic transmission is relevant to increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity  the latter being a neurobiological mechanism behind the development of the conditioned tolerance to diazepam."

Chronic kainate treatment  without producing excitotoxicity  resulted in preferential  dose- and time-dependent down-regulation of alpha1  alpha6 and beta2 subunit mRNA expression  the expression of beta3  gamma2 and delta subunit mRNAs being less affected. The down-regulation was reversed by DNQX  an AMPA/kainate-selective glutamate receptor antagonist. A 14-day kainate treatment resulted in 46% decrease of total [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to the benzodiazepine sites. Diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding was decreased by 89% in accordance with very low amount of alpha6 subunit mRNA present. Diazepam-sensitive [3H]Ro 154513 binding was decreased only by 40%  contrasting &gt;90% decrease in alpha1 subunit mRNA expression. However  this was consistent with lower potentiation of GABA-evoked currents in kainate-treated than control cells by the alpha1-selective benzodiazepine site ligand zolpidem  suggesting compensatory expression of alpha5 (and/or alpha2 or alpha3) subunits producing diazepam-sensitive but zolpidem-insensitive receptor subtypes.

However  in contrast to the GABA responses of embryonic neurons  the GABA responses of adult neurons are insensitive to both bicuculline and picrotoxin. We performed RT-PCR using subunit specific primer pairs  followed by Southern blot analysis with a third specific primer  to determine the pattern of subunit mRNA expression in cultures of embryonic and adult human DRG neurons. alpha2 and beta3 mRNA were expressed in all embryonic and adult cultures  while beta2 mRNA was present in all adult cultures but none of the embryonic cultures. Transcripts expressed by at least half of both embryonic and adult cultures were alpha3  alpha5  gamma2S  gamma3  theta  and rho1.

Therefore  in the present study  we investigated the effect of ethanol on long-term potentiation in synaptic pathway from the basolateral amygdala to the dentate gyrus by using anesthetized rats in vivo. I.v. (20-40% x 2 ml/kg) or i.c.v. (30-40% x 5 microl) administration of ethanol did not affect the basal amplitude of dentate gyrus field potential evoked by basolateral amygdala stimulation  but significantly inhibited the induction of long-term potentiation following application of tetanic stimulation. Since long-term potentiation in this pathway was independent of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors  the inhibitory effect of ethanol is unlikely to be caused by suppression of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor function. Alternatively  long-term potentiation in this pathway was significantly suppressed by the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam (2 mg/kg  i.p.)  and the inhibitory effect of ethanol was abolished by the GABAA receptor channel blocker picrotoxin (1 mg/kg  i.p.). The present study demonstrates that ethanol inhibits the induction of long-term potentiation in the basolateral amygdala-dentate gyrus pathway by enhancing GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission."

Seizures in adult male BALB/c mice  or C57BL/6 mice as reference  caused ipsilateral death of CA1 and CA3 neurons within the hippocampus. Termination of seizures by lorazepam was more effective than diazepam in both strains  largely restricting neuronal loss to the CA3 sector. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings defined injurious and non-injurious seizure patterns  which could not be separated adequately by behavioral observation alone. Degenerating neurons in the hippocampus were positive for DNA fragmentation and approximately a third of these exhibited morphologic features of programmed cell death.

The properties of GABA(A) IPSCs were compared before and after superfusion of modulators in control conditions (Li-saline rats) and in Li-pilocarpine rats 24-48 h and 3-5 months (epileptic rats) after status epilepticus (SE). The mean peak amplitude of GABA(A) IPSCs increased by about 40% over Li-saline values in GCs 24-48 h after SE and remained higher in epileptic rats. In Li-pilocarpine rats  studied at 24-48 h after SE  diazepam (1 microm) lost 65% of its effectiveness at increasing the half-decay time (T(50%)) of GABA(A) miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs). Diazepam had no effects on mIPSC T(50%) in epileptic rats. The benzodiazepine ligand flumazenil (1 microm)  acting as an antagonist in Li-saline rats  exhibited a potent inverse agonistic effect on GABA(A) mIPSCs of GCs from Li-pilocarpine rats 24-48 h and 3-5 months after SE. The neurosteroid allopregnanolone (100 nm)  which considerably prolonged GABA(A) mIPSCs in Li-saline rats  totally lost its effect in rats studied 24-48 h after SE. However  this decrease in effectiveness was transient and was totally restored in epileptic rats. In addition to the up-regulation in the number of receptors at individual GC synapses  we propose that these 'epileptic' GABA(A) receptors possess benzodiazepine binding sites with altered allosteric properties. The failure of benzodiazepine and neurosteroid to potentiate inhibition early after SE may be a critical factor in the development of epileptogenesis and occurrence of seizures."

In wild-type animals  diazepam reduced the expression levels of the alpha subunit of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II  as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor  MAP kinase phosphatase  transcription factor GIF  c-fos and nerve growth factor induced gene-A. None of these transcripts was changed in the alpha1(H101R) mice after treatment with diazepam. Thus  the sedative action of diazepam is correlated with a selective down-regulation of transcripts involved in the regulation of neuronal plasticity and neurotrophic responses. Most transcript changes were transient except for the decrease of the CaMKIIalpha transcript which persisted even 40 h after the single dose of diazepam. This long-term alteration is likely to contribute to the resetting of the neuronal responsiveness  which may be involved in rebound phenomena and  under chronic treatment  in the development of tolerance and dependence."

Previous studies showed that a system using C6 astrocyte glioma conditioned medium leads to cell layers with transendothelial electrical resistance values up to 300 Omega cm(2) and a permeability coefficient P(e) of 3.24 +/- 0.14 x 10(-4) cm/min for U-[(14)C]sucrose  which is in good agreement to published values and thus indicates the formation of tight junctions in vitro. However  commercially available inserts for the Transwell system were not permeable for highly lipophilic compounds  such as diazepam. Systematic studies with different insert showed  that inserts with a pore width of 1 microm proved to be optimal for permeation studies of lipophilic compounds. Permeability studies with a set of three benzodiazepines further supported this finding."

This prompted us to examine the phenotype of these mice in more detail. By cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings  we could not detect any changes  demonstrating that the motor disturbances are not epileptic in nature  an important similarity to human dystonia. The significantly decreased body weight of med(J) mice was related to reduced food intake. Observations in the open field and by video recordings revealed that the mice exhibit sustained abnormal postures and movements of limbs  trunk and tail not only during locomotor activity but also at rest. With the exception of the head tremor  the other motor impairments were persistent rather than paroxysmal. When several neurological reflexes were tested  alterations were restricted to the posture and righting reflexes. Results of the wire hang test confirmed the greatly reduced muscle strength in the med(J) mouse. In agreement with different types of human dystonia  biperiden  haloperidol and diazepam moderately reduced the severity of motor disturbances in med(J) mice. In view of the sodium channel deficiency in med(J) mice  the beneficial effects of the sodium channel blocker phenytoin was an unexpected finding. By immunohistochemical examinations  the density of nigral dopaminergic neurons was found to be unaltered  substantiating the absence of pathomorphological abnormalities within the brain of med(J) mice shown by previous studies. With the exception of muscle weakness  many of the features of the med(J) mouse are similar to human idiopathic dystonia."

We investigated the possible molecular constituents of this adaptation. We used a differential display reverse transcriptase-PCR screen for mRNAs isolated from retinas of rabbits that received HOKS. In each rabbit  we compared mRNAs from the retina stimulated in the posterior--&gt;anterior (preferred) direction with mRNAs from the retina stimulated in the anterior--&gt;posterior (null) direction. Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) mRNA was one of four mRNAs selected by this screen  the proteins of which interact with GABA receptors. HOKS in the preferred direction increased ACBP mRNA transcription and ACBP protein expression. ACBP was localized to Muller glial cells by hybridization histochemistry and by immunohistochemistry. ACBP interacts with the alpha1-subunit of the GABA(A) receptor  as determined by a yeast two-hybrid technique. This interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of ACBP and the alpha1-subunit of the GABA(A) receptor using an antibody to GABA(A)alpha1. The interaction was also confirmed by a &quot;pull-down&quot; assay in which histidine-tagged ACBP was used to pull down the GABA(A)alpha1. ACBP does not cross the blood-brain barrier. However  smaller truncated proteolytic fragments of ACBP do  increasing the excitability of central cortical neurons. Muller cells may secrete ACBP in the inner plexiform layer  thereby decreasing the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors expressed on the surface of ganglion cell dendrites. Because retinal directional sensitivity is linked to GABAergic transmission  HOKS-induced expression of ACBP could provide a molecular basis for adaptation to HOKS and for the genesis of OKAN-II."

The role of the alpha6 subunit gene cluster in the ethanol non-preferring phenotype was here investigated by measuring the levels of alpha1  alpha6 and gamma2 peptide in the cerebellum of normal (RR) and mutated (QQ) sNP rats after 2 weeks of chronic ethanol administration. Western blot analysis revealed that the alpha6 subunit is increased in RR sNP rats after chronic ethanol exposure (25.44%+/-8.69 versus control)  while it remained unchanged in mutated QQ sNP rats. Interestingly  chronic ethanol administration decreased alpha1 peptide levels in the cerebellum of both rat lines to a similar extent (30.99%+/-6.74 and 27.12%+/-9.83 in RR and QQ rats  respectively)  while gamma2 peptide levels remained unchanged. To further correlate the genetic and biochemical difference of the normal and mutated sNP rats with their aversive phenotype  we exposed sNP rats to a protocol of acquisition and maintenance of ethanol drinking. QQ sNP rats drank less ethanol than RR rats during the acquisition phase  but such difference was lost during the maintenance phase. These data may contribute to elucidating the mechanisms of alcohol avoidance in rat lines selected for this behavior when exposed to ethanol solution."

The effect of ethanol withdrawal on the expression of the alpha(2) subunit of this receptor was examined with rat cerebellar granule cells in primary culture. Long-term exposure of these cells to ethanol (100 mM  5 days) did not affect the abundance of the mRNA for the alpha(2) subunit  as revealed by an RNase protection assay. In contrast  subsequent ethanol withdrawal for 3 h induced a marked increase in the amount of this mRNA (2.6-fold) as well as in that of the encoded polypeptide (2.2-fold)  the latter revealed by immunoblot analysis. Exposure of the cells to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (100 mM) during ethanol withdrawal prevented the increase in the amounts of both the alpha(2) mRNA and polypeptide  whereas similar treatment with diazepam (10 microM) blocked the increase in the abundance of the alpha(2) polypeptide but not that in the amount of the alpha(2) mRNA. The effect of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid was not blocked by the competitive GABA(B) receptor antagonist SCH 50911(10 microM). Given that the alpha(2) subunit of the GABA(A) receptor mediates the anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines  its up-regulation during discontinuation of long-term ethanol exposure might be relevant to the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of anxiety associated with ethanol withdrawal."

It is currently used in clinical treatment of ulcer diseases. Systemic administration of carbenoxolone (1-40 mg/kg  intraperitoneally (i.p.)) was able to produce a dose-dependent decrease in DBA/2 audiogenic seizure severity score. Glycyrrhizin  an analogue of carbenoxolone inactive at the gap-junction level  was unable to affect audiogenic seizures at doses up to 30 mg/kg. In combination with conventional antiepileptic drugs  carbenoxolone  0.5 mg/kg  i.p.  which per se did not significantly affect the occurrence of audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice  potentiated the anticonvulsant activity of carbamazepine  diazepam  felbamate  gabapentin  lamotrigine  phenytoin  phenobarbital and valproate against sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice. This effect was not observed after the combination of glycyrrhizin (10 mg/kg  i.p.) with some conventional antiepileptic drugs. The degree of potentiation induced by carbenoxolone was greater for diazepam  felbamate  gabapentin  phenobarbital and valproate  less for lamotrigine  phenytoin and carbamazepine. This increase was associated with a comparable impairment in motor activity; however  the therapeutic index of combined treatment of antiepileptic drugs with carbenoxolone was more favourable than the combination with glycyrrhizin or saline. Since carbenoxolone did not significantly influence the total and free plasma levels of diazepam  felbamate  gabapentin  lamotrigine  phenytoin  phenobarbital  valproate and carbamazepine  pharmacokinetic interactions are not likely. However  the possibility that carbenoxolone can modify the brain clearance of the anticonvulsant drugs studied may not be excluded. In addition  carbenoxolone did not significantly affect the hypothermic effects of the anticonvulsants tested. In conclusion  carbenoxolone showed an additive anticonvulsant effect when administered in combination with some classical anticonvulsants  most notably diazepam  felbamate  gabapentin  phenobarbital  and valproate  implicating a possible therapeutic relevance of such drug combinations."

In all parts of the brain  putrescine levels were elevated (139-157% of the control) 24 h after water-immersion restraint stress. In the case of restraint  however  elevation of the putrescine level (130% of the control) was detected only in the frontal cortex. Spermidine and spermine levels were unchanged or slightly reduced (80-85% of the control) in the brain 6 and 24 h after water-immersion restraint stress. There was no change in plasma polyamine levels at any time subsequent to the stress. Pretreatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg  i.p.) completely blocked the stress-induced putrescine increases. These results indicate that the magnitude of the putrescine increase is dependent upon the intensity of the stressor  and suggest that polyamine metabolism is linked to psychological stress."

The impact of such changes on GABA(A) receptor function and pharmacological sensitivity was investigated with cultured rat hippocampal neurons exposed to ethanol for 5 d and then subjected to ethanol withdrawal. Both ethanol treatment and withdrawal were associated with a marked decrease in the maximal density of GABA-evoked Cl- currents  whereas the potency of GABA was unaffected. Ethanol exposure also reduced the modulatory efficacy of the benzodiazepine receptor agonists lorazepam  zolpidem  and zaleplon as well as that of the inverse agonists Ro 15-4513 and FG 7142  effects that were associated with a reduced abundance of mRNAs encoding the receptor subunits alpha1  alpha3  gamma2L  and gamma2S. Ethanol withdrawal restored the efficacy of lorazepam  but not that of low concentrations of zolpidem or zaleplon  to control values. Flumazenil  which was ineffective in control neurons  and Ro 15-4513 each potentiated the GABA response after ethanol withdrawal. These effects of withdrawal were accompanied by upregulation of the alpha2  alpha3  and alpha4 subunit mRNAs as well as of the alpha4 protein. Diazepam or gamma-hydroxybutyrate  but not baclofen  prevented the changes in both GABA(A) receptor pharmacology and subunit mRNA levels induced by ethanol withdrawal. Changes in GABA(A) receptor gene expression induced by prolonged exposure to and withdrawal of ethanol are thus associated with altered GABA(A) receptor function and pharmacological sensitivity."

Given that diverse forms of anxiety exist  numerous animal models have been developed  which are considered to be useful in identifying mechanisms underlying anxiety states. Examples of such animal models include paradigms that assess the behavioral response to neurogenic (or painful stimuli) or psychogenic stressors or to cues that had previously been associated with painful stimuli. The present report presents data regarding the impact of stressors on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)  and relates these to changes in anxiety-like states. Specifically  we demonstrate that (1) psychogenic stressors influence the in vivo release of CRH at the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA); (2) although CRH changes within the CeA are exquisitely sensitive to stressors  they are also elicited by positive stimuli; and (3) while treatment with diazepam attenuates behavioral signs of anxiety  the CRH release associated with a stressor is unaffected by the treatment. The position is offered that although release of CRH within the CeA is increased under stressful conditions  it is not a necessary condition for the consequent behavioral expression of anxiety-like reactions  at least not in minimally threatening situations. We suggest that the CRH responses at the CeA may be involved in a preparatory capacity and  as such  may accompany a range of emotionally significant stimuli  be they appetitive or aversive."

In vivo1H-NMR spectroscopy showed  in epileptic rats after creatine administration  higher hippocampal NAA concentrations  suggesting improved neuronal survival. However  in vitro observation of hippocampal slices from creatine-treated epileptic rats revealed a more pronounced loss of pyramidal neurons and decrease in activity of mitochondrial enzymes in hippocampal subfields.

Stereo-EEG has demonstrated that dysplastic areas show continuous spiking activity persisting after diazepam injection and are the site of ictal discharge onset. Surgery guided by stereo-EEG made seizure-free outcome possible for all patients recently investigated and who had undergone surgery in our centre for extra-temporal partial epilepsy associated with focal cortical dysplasias (10 patients  mean follow-up: 15 months). Moreover  we demonstrated that limited resections can be performed safely in eloquent cortex without permanent disability. These results demonstrate the usefulness of stereo-EEG in surgical treatment for focal cortical dysplasias  despite the invasive nature of this procedure."

Other molecules with major morphogenetic roles are the nitric oxide free radical (NO(.)) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)  both of which are involved in the control of synaptic plasticity and apoptosis. In the present work  we investigated the effect of GABA-A receptor activation on neuronal NO(.) synthase (nNOS) and BDNF immunoreactivity in the developing cortex of 5-day-old rats. We also determined the effect of GABA-A receptor activation on phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (pCREB) immunoreactivity in an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. Our results show that activation of GABA-A receptors leads to increased numbers of nNOS  BDNF and pCREB  as well as nNOS-pCREB and BDNF-pCREB doubly immunopositive cells. This effect is abolished when L-type Ca(2+) channels are blocked. These results indicate that the following mechanism could be operating: depolarization following GABA-A receptor activation leads to opening of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels  resulting in an increased Ca(2+) influx  which in turn leads to phosphorylation and  thus  activation  of the transcription factor CREB; the phosphorylated CREB can then induce BDNF  as well as nNOS."

THIP activated GABA(A) channels after a delay that was concentration-dependent and decreased by 1 microM diazepam. The currents showed outward rectification. Channels activated at depolarized 40 mV relative to the chloride reversal potential had low conductance (&lt;40 pS) but the conductance increased with time  resulting in high-conductance channels (&gt;40 pS). The average maximal-channel conductances for 2 and 100 microM THIP were 59 and 62 pS (-Vp = 40 mV)  respectively  whereas in 2 microM THIP plus 1 microM diazepam  it was 71 pS.

The intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by Fura 2-AM fluorescence labeling assay. Using RT-PCR  the mRNA level of nerve growth factor (NGF) was also detected.RESULTS: High concentration of corticosterone (0.2 mmol/L) was incubated with PC12 cells to simulate the lesion state of brain neurons in depressive illness. Three main kinds of antidepressants used in clinic [(1) tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  such as desipramine (DIM) 0.625-10 micromol/L; (2) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  such as fluoxetine (FLU) 0.625-10 micromol/L; (3) monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)  such as moclobemide (MOC) 2.5-40 micromol/L] protected cells from the lesion induced by corticosterone. While antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine or anxiolytic agent diazepam 0.4-50 micromol/L had no such effect. Moreover  DIM 1  5 micromol/L or FLU 1  5 micromol/L attenuated the [Ca2+]i overload induced by corticosterone 0.1 mmol/L for 48 h in PC12 cells.

Dramatic changes in the expression of MMPs and TIMPs occur during excitotoxic/neuroinflammatory processes. However  only the measurement of net protease activity is relevant physiologically  and the functional consequences of MMP/TIMP ratio modifications in the brain remain elusive. In order to assess MMP activity and effects in brain tissue  we combined in vivo and organotypic culture models of kainate (KA)-induced excitotoxicity to provoke selective neuronal death and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. Using in situ zymography  we show that KA-induced excitotoxic seizures in rats increase net MMP activity in hippocampal neurons 8 h after seizures  before their death  and that this increase is neuronal activity-dependent. Three days after KA  proteolytic activity increases in blood vessels and reactive glial cells of vulnerable areas  in relation with neuroinflammation. At 7 and 15 days  proteolysis remains high in blood vessels whereas it is reduced in glia. In organotypic hippocampal cultures  which lack blood cell-mediated inflammation and extrinsic connections  a broad-spectrum inhibitor of MMPs (MMPI)  but also a selective MMP-9 inhibitor  protect hippocampal neurons against KA-induced excitotoxicity. Moreover  recombinant MMP-9  but not MMP-2  induces selective pyramidal cell death in these cultures and KA-induced neuronal activity exacerbates the neuronal death promoting effects of MMP-9. These data strongly implicate MMPs  and MMP-9 in particular  in both excitotoxic neuronal damage and subsequent neuroinflammatory processes  and suggest that selective MMPIs could be therapeutically relevant in related neurological disorders."

In previous reports  we demonstrated a positive correlation between the development of tolerance to the sedative effects of DZ and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Furthermore  previous exposure to the drug administration context blocks both the tolerance to sedative effects of DZ and the increased hippocampal plasticity. The results of the present investigation show that the development of tolerance to hypolocomotor action of DZ (5 mg/kg/day) for 4 days results in a significant increase in the hybridization signals for mRNA for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptor NR1 and NR2B subunits in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Furthermore  we have observed more benzodiazepine binding sites in the hippocampus of non-tolerant animals.

To investigate the role of IL-6 during stress  we measured mRNA levels of IL-6 by quantitative PCR in various tissues 60 min after exposure of mice to open field stress. IL-6 mRNA was elevated in the hypothalamus three-fold and in the pituitary two-fold. However  there was no difference between the increase in body temperature after exposure to 60 min open field stress in wild-type controls (35.2+/-0.6-37.3+/-0.5 degrees C) and IL-6-deficient animals (34.8+/-0.4-37.0+/-0.3 degrees C). In contrast to body temperature  emotional behaviour differed between wild-type controls and IL-6-deficient mice. IL-6-deficient animals showed higher locomotor activity in an open field and lower levels of exploration of the open arms of the elevated plus maze than control animals. These data suggest that IL-6 plays an important role in the control of emotionality  but not in the regulation of body temperature after psychological stress."

To better understand how intracortical inhibition triggers experience-dependent changes  we dissected the precise timing requirement for GABA function in the monocular deprivation (MD) paradigm. Diazepam (DZ) or vehicle solution was infused daily before and/or during 4 d of MD in GAD65 knock-out mice. Extracellular single-unit recordings from the binocular zone of visual cortex were performed at the end of deprivation. We found that a minimum treatment of 2 d near the beginning of MD was sufficient to fully activate plasticity but did not need to overlap the deprivation per se. Extended delay after DZ infusion eventually led to loss of plasticity accompanied by improved intrinsic inhibitory circuit function. Two day DZ treatment just after eye opening similarly closed the critical period prematurely in wild-type mice. Raising wild-type mice in complete darkness from birth delayed the peak sensitivity to MD as in other mammals. Interestingly  2 d DZ infusion in the dark also closed the critical period  whereas equally brief light exposure during dark-rearing had no such effect. Thus  enhanced tonic signaling through GABA(A) receptors rapidly creates a milieu for plasticity within neocortex capable of triggering a critical period for ocular dominance independent of visual experience itself."

After &gt;75 min to allow the tranquilization to abate  structural images were acquired from three coronal brain slices. Subsequently  functional images were taken utilizing 4-min epochs without stimulation alternated with equivalent epochs during which the right caudal whiskers were stimulated with three air puffs/s. After 4 weeks  fMRI could be repeated in four rats. In seven of the nine functional runs  head motion was minimal and whisker stimulation resulted in a statistically significant (P &lt;/= 0.05) increase in BOLD signal in barrel cortex predominantly on the contralateral side. The results provide encouragement that long-term fMRI studies on cerebral function in unanesthetized rats may be feasible with our procedure."

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  used to treat seizures in children  infants  and pregnant women  cause cognitive impairment  microcephaly  and birth defects by unknown mechanisms. We tested whether common AEDs cause neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain. Rats aged 3-30 days received phenytoin  phenobarbital  diazepam  clonazepam  vigabatrin  or valproic acid. Histologic examination of the brains revealed that these drugs cause widespread and dose-dependent apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain during the brain growth spurt period. Apoptotic neurodegeneration was triggered at plasma drug levels relevant for seizure control in humans. Antiepileptic drugs lead to reduced expression of neurotrophins and decreased concentrations of the active forms of ERK1/2  RAF  and AKT. beta-Estradiol  which stimulates pathways that are activated by neurotrophins  ameliorated AEDs-induced apoptotic neurodegeneration. Our findings present one possible mechanism to explain cognitive impairment and reduced brain mass associated with pre- or postnatal exposure of humans to antiepileptic therapy."
"722","12850575","Increased neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity triggers picrotoxin-induced seizures in rats and evidence for participation of nNOS mechanism in the action of antiepileptic drugs.","Increased neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity was observed during the prodromal period of seizures in various rat brain regions following administration of GABA(A) receptor antagonist  picrotoxin (PCT). Pretreatment with the selective nNOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI)  dose- and time-dependently delayed the onset of clonus with a corresponding decrease in nNOS activity. The threshold dose of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; diazepam  phenobarbitone and gabapentin) have potentiated the anticonvulsant action by pretreatment with graded doses of 7-NI. The increase in efficacy of anticonvulsant action correlated with a corresponding decrease of PCT-evoked increase in nNOS activity. The present data support a role for abnormal nNOS activity in mechanisms that trigger seizures and suggest a possible NO-mediated interplay between GABA(A) and glutamate receptors. The results of the present study provide evidence for a trigger role of neuronally produced NO in epileptogenesis induced by PCT and the participation of nNOS inhibitory mechanisms in the action of AEDs."

[11C]Metomidate (MTO)  a potent inhibitor of this enzyme  is used for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of adrenocortical pathology. The synthesis of (R)-1-(1-phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylic acid 2-[18F]fluoroethylester (FETO)  a close analogue to MTO and etomidate (ETO)  has been presented recently  and the present investigation aimed to characterise the in vivo distribution of FETO. Since ETO is a well-known anaesthetic drug acting via the GABAergic system  the interaction of FETO with GABAA receptors was also evaluated. Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with 1.73-3.06 MBq of FETO into a tail vein after venodilatation in a 40 degrees C water bath. Rats were sacrificed by exsanguination from the abdominal aorta under deep ether anaesthesia after 10 (n=6)  30 (n=6) or 60 min (n=6); organs were removed  weighed and counted. For binding experiments  rat cerebellar membranes were incubated for 90 min at 4 degrees C in TC-50 buffer  150 mM NaCl and 2 nM of [3H]flunitrazepam in the absence or presence of 10 microM diazepam or various concentrations of ETO  MTO and FETO. In vivo evaluation evinced very high uptake in the adrenal glands (7.52%+/-1.19% ID/g at 30 min)  followed by lung (1.18%+/-0.19% ID/g  10 min)  liver (0.59%+/-0.13% ID/g  10 min) and duodenum (0.7%+/-0.29% ID/g  60 min). No defluorination nor fluoroethyl-ester cleavage was observed. When brain regions were compared with the thalamus (the reference region)  highest relative uptake was seen in the cortex (2.34)  followed by &quot;rest brain&quot; (2.13) and cerebellum (1.96). FETO and ETO were able to increase the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam with similar potencies and to a comparable extent. It is concluded that FETO shows characteristics suitable for the imaging of adrenocortical pathology with PET. Binding experiments on GABA receptors demonstrate a comparable effect of FETO and ETO. Hence  FETO possibly could also be used to elucidate the function  dynamics and kinetics of narcotic drugs with PET."

The treatment regimen consisted of LND 450 mg/day and diazepam 15 mg/day orally of every 28-day cycle until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients received a median of three cycles (range  1-12). No complete or partial response was observed. Therefore  according to the design of the study  no additional patients were enrolled and the trial was closed. Nevertheless  seven stabilizations (50%) were observed. Median time to progression was 8 weeks (range  5-19 weeks). Median overall survival from recurrence was 15 weeks (range  14-61 weeks). No grade 3-4 toxicity  except somnolence  was observed and there were no therapy-related deaths. Dose reduction for diazepam due to somnolence (grade III) was performed in 9 patients. The combination of LND and diazepam is well tolerated. LND and diazepam  acting on two distinct mitochondrial sites involved in cellular energy metabolism  may exert a cytostatic effect on tumour growth as shown by the high percentage of stable patients. The LND-diazepam at the used dosing schedule did not show a complete or partial response. LND plus diazepam may be interesting in the adjuvant setting or associated to chemotherapy to act on different targets and increase the therapeutic index."

In p-chloroamphetamine-pretreated rats  neither WAY 100635 (1 mg/kg) nor MP 349 (0.25 mg/kg) induced an anticonflict effect  whereas MM 77 (0.06 mg/kg) did produce it.

The present results suggest that  first  the anticonflict effect of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists  WAY 100635 and MP 349  but not MM 77  is linked to the presynaptically located 5-HT(1A) receptors  and second  benzodiazepine receptors are indirectly involved in such effects of WAY 100635  MP 349 and MM 77  due maybe to a possible interaction between the 5-HT and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine systems."

Nooglutil (5 nM-750 microM) had no effect on in vitro binding of (3)H-spiperone in intact rats. Systemic administration of 50 mg/kg nooglutil in vivo increased the dissociation constant and density of D(2)receptors. Increasing the dose to 100 mg/kg abolished this effect.

"728","12798267","Reduced attention in mice overproducing corticotropin-releasing hormone.","Data from several studies suggest that unrestrained secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone in the CNS produces several signs and symptoms of depression. Recent evidence indicates that blockade of the CRH receptor 1 reduced depression scores in depressed patients. One of the symptoms that occur is depression is impairment in attentional processes. Whether these impairments are due to alterations in the CRH system are so far unknown. In order to investigate whether overproduction of CRH alters attentional process  transgenic mice overproducing CRH were tested on an operant five choice serial reaction time task  a task which taxes sustained and divided attention. Mutants showed impaired autoshaping. During initial discrimination learning  transgenics performed below wildtype level  but with extended training with long stimulus durations  transgenic animals reached similar accuracy levels as wildtype mice. When animals were tested at shortest stimulus duration (0.5s)  a mild but significant impairment in accurate responding emerged in transgenics. This was accompanied by longer correct response latencies  while incorrect latencies did not differ between groups  suggesting attentional impairment in CRH transgenics. Because these animals have been reported to also show increased anxiety-related behaviour  animals were treated with the anxiolytic benzodiazepine diazepam. Diazepam failed to affect accuracy  but transgenic mice showed a stronger behavioural disinhibition. This suggests that the attentional impairment seen in CRH overexpressors is independent of alterations in anxiety-like behaviour. These findings may have implications for understanding the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders such as depression  where it has been suggested that an overactivity of the CRH system accounts for a variety of symptoms  including hyper-arousal and attentional impairment."
"729","12786990","Diazepam-induced changes on sleep and the EEG spectrum in mice: role of the alpha3-GABA(A) receptor subtype.","Benzodiazepines reduce EEG slow-wave activity in non-REM sleep by potentiating GABAergic neurotransmission at GABAA receptors via a modulatory binding site. However  the mechanisms of action underlying the effects of benzodiazepines on sleep and the sleep EEG are still unknown. Slow waves during sleep are generated by the corticothalamic system and synchronized by the inhibitory GABAergic neurons of the reticular thalamic nucleus. This region contains exclusively alpha3-containing GABAA receptors. We investigated the role of these receptors in the mediation of diazepam effects on the sleep EEG by studying point-mutated mice in which the alpha3-GABAA receptor is diazepam-insensitive [alpha3(H126R)]. Sleep was recorded for 12 h after i.p. injection of 3 mg/kg diazepam or vehicle at light onset in alpha3(H126R) and wild-type controls (n = 13-17 per genotype). The main effect was a marked reduction of slow-wave activity (EEG power density in 0.75-4.00 Hz) in non-REM sleep and a concomitant increase in frequencies above 15.00 Hz in non-REM sleep and waking in both genotypes. Neither effect of diazepam differed significantly between the genotypes. Despite the exclusive expression of alpha3-containing GABAA receptors in the reticular thalamic nucleus  these receptors do not seem to be critical for the mediation of the effects of diazepam on the sleep EEG."

The present study tested the hypothesis that pressure can differentiate coupling initiated by a spectrum of benzodiazepine receptor ligands by measuring the effects of pressure on benzodiazepine ligand modulation of GABA-activated 36Cl(-) uptake in mouse brain membranes. 12 ATA completely antagonized allosteric modulation by: benzodiazepine receptor agonists diazepam and flunitrazepam; Type-1 selective benzodiazepine receptor agonist zolpidem and the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist ethyl-8-azido-5 6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1 5-alpha][1 4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro15-4513). The similar  non-competitive-like characteristics of pressure antagonism of these ligands suggest common structural/functional elements underlying their coupling. Pressure also antagonized allosteric modulation by the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist methyl 6 7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM)  but the antagonism was not complete and appeared to be surmountable (competitive-like) suggesting unexpected differences in coupling for DMCM versus Ro15-4513. These studies represent the first attempt to use pressure as a tool to dissect benzodiazepine receptor coupling. The results suggest that there is a common  pressure antagonism sensitive structural/functional element underlying coupling for benzodiazepine receptor ligands and that coupling for the full inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist DMCM differs from coupling for benzodiazepine receptor agonists and benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonists."

EEG and pneumo-physiological parameters were simultaneously recorded. When atropine was administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg  seizures were observed in 87.5% of the cases; if an anticonvulsant was added (diazepam (2 mg/kg) or avizafone (3.5 mg/kg))  seizure was prevented but respiratory disorders were observed. At 33.8 mg/kg  atropine markedly increased the seizure threshold and prevented early respiratory distress induced by sarin. When diazepam was administered together with atropine  seizures were not observed but 62.5% of the animals displayed respiratory difficulties. These symptoms were not observed when using avizafone. The pharmacokinetic data showed marked variation of the plasma levels of atropine and diazepam in different antidote combination groups  where groups receiving diazepam exhibited the lowest concentration of atropine in plasma. Taken together  the results indicate that avizafone is suitable in therapy against sarin when an anticonvulsant is judged necessary."

We also examined the effects of these benzodiazepines on in vivo melatonin secretion in the Harderian glands. Neither DZP (10(-5)-10(-6)M) nor its metabolites (10(-4)-10(-5)M) affected melatonin secretion by perifused rat pineal glands in vitro. In contrast  a 10(-4)M suprapharmacological concentration of DZP increased melatonin secretion of perifused pineal glands by 70%. In vivo  a single acute subcutaneous administration of DZP (3 mg/kg body weight) significantly affected pineal melatonin synthesis and plasma melatonin levels  while administration of the metabolites under the same conditions did not. DZP reduced pineal melatonin content (-40%)  N-acetyltransferase activity (-70%)  and plasma melatonin levels (-40%)  but had no affects on pineal hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity. Neither DZP nor its metabolites affected Harderian gland melatonin content. Our results indicate that the in vivo inhibitory effect of DZP on melatonin synthesis is not due to the metabolism of DZP.

In the BWT  TCWa (0.1-1.0 g/kg  p.o.) increased the time spent in the white chamber and total change between the two chambers  and decreased the time spent in the black chamber. TCWa (0.1-0.5 g/kg  p.o.) increased the arm entries and the time spent on the open arms  and decreased the arm entries and the time spent on the closed arms in the EPM. On the other hand  TCWa (1.0 g/kg  p.o.) decreased horizontal activity and prolonged pentobarbital-induced sleeping times. TCWa (0.1  0.5 g/kg) decreased the levels of norepinephrine (NE)  dopamine (DA)  5-HT and 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and increased the levels of vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the brain stem. TCWa (0.1 and 0.5 g/kg) decreased the levels of NE  DA and increased the levels of VMA and HVA in the cortex. TCWa also attenuated the anxiogenic effect of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and enhanced the anxiolytic effect of 9p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA)  buspirone (BUS) and ritanserin (RIT) in the EPM. From these results  TCWa at 0.1 and 0.5 g/kg possessed an anxiolytic effect T heanxiolytic mechanisms of TCWa might be due to decreased catecholaminergic activity caused by the increase in the turnover rate of catecholamines in the brain and decreased concentrations of 5-HT in the brain stemvia activating somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors and inhibiting postsynaptic 5-HT receptors."

Chronic treatment produced complete tolerance in both mouse lines. Ligand autoradiography revealed a significant reduction in baseline benzodiazepine and chloride channel site-bindings in various regions of the alpha6 -/- brains  but the chronic diazepam treatment did not consistently alter baseline or benzodiazepine site agonist and inverse agonist-modulated binding in the alpha6 -/- and wildtype mice. The results indicate that tolerance to motor-impairing actions of diazepam is independent of the diazepam-insensitive alpha6 subunit-containing receptors  which rules out the possibility that tolerance emerges as an increase in structurally benzodiazepine-insensitive receptor population."

These clinical observations gave rise to notions of an endogenous BZ-like mechanism in HE  but to date no viable candidate compounds have been characterized. We show here that the hemoglobin (Hb) metabolites hemin and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) interact with the BZ site on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor and enhance inhibitory synaptic transmission in a manner similar to diazepam and zolpidem. This finding suggests that hemin and PPIX are neuroactive porphyrins capable of acting as endogenous ligands for the central BZ site.

The parameters of benzodiazepine receptors were analysed using [3H]-flunitrazepam binding.RESULTS: In the plus-maze test  the exploratory activity of the homozygous (-/-) mice was significantly higher compared to their wild-type (+/+) littermates. However  the wild-type (+/+) mice displayed higher sensitivity to the anxiolytic-like action of diazepam. Even the lowest dose of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) induced a significant increase of open arm entries in the wild-type (+/+) mice. A similar effect in the homozygous (-/-) mice was established after the administration of diazepam 1 mg/kg. The highest dose of diazepam (3 mg/kg) caused a prominent anxiolytic-like effect in the wild-type (+/+) mice  whereas in the homozygous (-/-) animals suppression of locomotor activity was evident. The performance of the homozygous (-/-) mice in the rotarod test did not differ from that of the wild-type (+/+) littermates. However  a difference between the wild-type (+/+) and homozygous (-/-) animals became evident after treatment with diazepam. Diazepam (0.5 and 3 mg/kg) induced significantly stronger impairment of motor co-ordination in the homozygous (-/-) mice compared to their wild-type (+/+) littermates. The density of benzodiazepine binding sites was increased in the cerebellum  but not in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus  of the homozygous (-/-) mice.CONCLUSIONS: Female mice lacking CCK2 receptors are less anxious than their wild-type (+/+) littermates. The reduced anxiety in homozygous (-/-) mice probably explains why the administration of a higher dose of diazepam is necessary to induce an anxiolytic-like action in these animals. The highest dose of diazepam (3 mg/kg) induced significantly stronger suppression of locomotor activity and impairment of motor co-ordination in the homozygous (-/-) mice compared to the wild-type (+/+) littermates. The increase in the action of diazepam is probably related to the elevated density of benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebellum of homozygous (-/-) mice. The present study seems to be in favour of increased tone of the GABAergic system in mice without CCK2 receptors."

Mitochondria from cerebrum showed a 27% lowering of TBARS whereas those from cerebellum and brain stem showed 48 and 24% enhanced MDA levels respectively. No significant alteration in the SOD isozymes was observed after the dose schedule. The mitochondrial glutathione reductase (GR) activity showed a decrease in all the regions with maximum decrease (36%) recorded in brain stem while post mitochondrial fraction showed significant lowering in cerebrum (37%). Total -SH content increased in all the three regions with maximum enhancement recorded in cerebellum while the free thiol content also showed significant changes (p &lt; 0.001) in cerebellum and brain stem. One week after the withdrawal of the drug MDA levels decreased by 38% in cerebrum and 53% each in mitochondrial fractions of cerebellum and brain stem. Regional heterogeneity in response was also observed in the post mitochondrial fractions. Mn-SOD showed lowered activity in cerebellum (22%) and in brain stem (15%). The mitochondrial GR activity decreased in all the regions being highest in cerebrum with no significant change in post mitochondrial fractions. The total and free -SH content in the withdrawn animals increased by 46% in cerebellum with no change in the other two regions. The results indicate towards lower oxidative phenomenon during 3 weeks treatment with diazepam while abrupt withdrawal causes lowering of antioxidant defenses which showed regional heterogeneity. A decrease in peroxidative decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acids of membranes was observed on withdrawal  which could be due to stabilisation of membranes after long-term binding of diazepam."

Drugs active at alpha(2)-adrenoceptors are known to modulate the head twitch response  the behaviour supposedly mediated by 5-HT(2A) receptors.OBJECTIVES: We tested whether swim stress modulates head twitch behaviour in mice and whether alpha(2)-adrenoceptors interfere with this effect.METHODS: The mice were stressed (10 min swimming at 18-19 degrees C)  and the head twitch response was produced by 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP  the precursor of serotonin) or by 1-(2 5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI  a selective 5-HT(2) receptor agonist) administered IP before or after swimming. Yohimbine (a non-selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist)  idazoxan (a selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) and diazepam were also used.RESULTS: Swim stress inhibited profoundly the 5-HTP-induced head twitch behaviour in mice. alpha(2)-Adrenoceptor antagonists and diazepam failed to counteract this effect. The head twitch behaviour produced by DOI given before or after stress was also inhibited. Repeatedly stressed mice had only a mild inhibition of the head twitch response.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that swim stress inhibits  by an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor unrelated mechanism  5-HT(2A) receptor-mediated head twitch behaviour in mice  suggesting that this effect and the swim stress-induced anticonvulsant effect are produced by two separate and independent mechanisms."
"742","12691780","The neurochemical effects of anxiolytic drugs are dependent on rearing conditions in Fawn-Hooded rats.","There is a vast literature examining the neurochemical effects of anxiolytics throughout the rat brain; however  although the behavioural actions of anxiolytic drugs are routinely assessed in animal models of anxiety  the majority of neurochemical studies have been performed in rats with relatively 'normal' behavioural phenotypes. Since there is significant evidence that an anxious phenotype is associated with numerous neurochemical alterations  it is feasible that the central effects of anxiolytics may vary depending on the underlying behavioural state (and corresponding neuropathology) of the experimental animal. For this reason  the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of chronic anxiolytic drug administration on the central CCK and dopamine systems in anxious (isolated from weaning) and nonanxious (group-housed) Fawn-Hooded (FH) rats. It is important to note that these studies were performed in rats with continued access to ethanol  which may affect the responses to anxiolytic treatment. Chronic anxiolytic treatment with the selective CCK-B (CCK(2)) receptor antagonist  Ci-988 (0.3 mg/kg/day ip) or diazepam (2 mg/kg/day ip)  induced numerous effects throughout the central nervous system (CNS)  with Ci-988 inducing significant changes in the density of dopamine D(2) receptors  and diazepam producing marked changes in both dopamine D(2) and CCK-B receptor binding density as well as preproCCK mRNA expression. Interestingly  the neurochemical effects of these anxiolytic drugs varied significantly depending on the rearing conditions of the rats  demonstrating the importance of using adequate animal models when correlating the behavioural and central effects of drugs acting throughout the CNS."

We performed binding studies in the cerebellum of normal (RR) and mutated (QQ) sNP rats using [3H]Ro 15-4513  an inverse agonist for the benzodiazepine site which binds both diazepam insensitive and diazepam sensitive sites. Saturation curves performed on cerebellar membrane from genotyped rats indicated an higher affinity of [3H]Ro 15-4513 for GABA(A) receptors in QQ with respect to RR rats (K(d) values 4.0+/-0.67 and 6.24+/-0.95 nM  respectively)  with similar B(max) values (3.5+/-0.25 and 3.9+/-0.39 pmol/mg protein  respectively). Diazepam displacement curves showed a two component model for both genotypes  with similar K(i1) values for QQ and RR (3.6+/-0.62 and 4.9+/-0.33 nM  respectively). In QQ rats diazepam is able to completely displace [3H]Ro 15-4513 (K(i2)=1.48+/-0.27 microM)  while in RR rats the diazepam sensitive sites are still present (K(i2)&gt;10 microM). The basal mRNA and protein expression level of the alpha(6) subunit were similar in RR and QQ rats. The electrophysiological profile of oocytes of Xenopus laevis injected with cerebellar synaptosomes showed that ethanol positively modulated GABA-evoked currents significantly more in QQ than in RR rats. These data contribute to the characterization of the function of GABA(A) alpha(6) subunit and its involvement in determining alcohol related behavior."

The molecular basis for this therapeutic efficacy was investigated with primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells. Long-term exposure of these cells to ethanol (100 mM  5 days) reduced the abundance of mRNAs encoding the gamma(2)L and gamma(2)S subunits of the GABA type A receptor (-32 and -23%  respectively) but failed to affect that of alpha(1)  alpha(4)  or alpha(6) subunit mRNAs. Subsequent ethanol withdrawal resulted in decreases in the amounts of alpha(1) (-29%)  alpha(6) (-27%)  gamma(2)L (-64%)  and gamma(2)S (-76%) subunit mRNAs that were maximal after 6 to 12 h. In contrast  3 h after ethanol withdrawal  the abundance of the alpha(4) subunit mRNA was increased by 46%. Ethanol withdrawal did not affect neuronal morphology but reduced cellular metabolic activity. The increase in alpha(4) subunit was confirmed by functional studies showing a positive action of flumazenil in patch clamp recordings of GABA-stimulated currents after ethanol withdrawal. Diazepam (10 microM) or GHB (100 mM) prevented the increase in the amount of the alpha(4) subunit mRNA  the metabolic impairment  and the positive action of flumazenil induced by ethanol withdrawal but failed to restore the expression of the alpha(1) and gamma(2) subunits. The antagonism by GHB seems not to be mediated by a direct action at GABA(A)R because GHB failed to potentiate the effects of GABA or diazepam on Cl(-) currents mediated by GABA type A receptor."

Here  we characterized the behavioral and autonomic responsivity to acute stress exposure in adult PS subjects. In Wistar rats  locomotor activity  as well as spontaneous behavior in an established animal model of anxiety  the elevated plus-maze  was unaffected by PS. However  the anxiogenic-like response normally seen on the plus-maze following a restraint stress was markedly potentiated in adult PS subjects  despite indistinguishable corticosterone responses. In addition  we assessed the tail skin temperature response to a mild social stressor  transient social mixing. The diazepam-sensitive  late phase of the temperature response was markedly potentiated in adult PS subjects. In summary  PS induces a persistent phenotype of increased behavioral and autonomic sensitivity to stress. This paradigm might serve as an attractive screening model for anti-anxiety compounds."

The method was used to simultaneously determine the concentrations of all analytes in a small sample volume (as little as 25 microL) of rat CSF. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) of the method are 0.04 ng/mL for DZP and 0.1 ng/mL for its metabolites. The calibration range is 0.04-200 ng/mL for DZP and 0.1-200 ng/ml for the metabolites. All intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (%CV) and mean percent errors of the method are less than 12%. This method successfully addresses the need to determine low therapeutic drug concentrations in small physiological samples  namely rat CSF. Moreover  it can be used to investigate the distribution of the drug and its metabolites among blood plasma  brain tissue  and CSF in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in a variety of laboratory animals. With respect to animal experiments involving assays in CSF  this method addresses two of the three criteria of Russell and Bruch (Principles of Humane Experimental Techniques  1959  Methuen and Co.  London) for minimizing animal use  namely refinement and reduction."
"747","12620284","Diazepam and chlormethiazole attenuate the development of hyperthermia in an animal model of the serotonin syndrome.","The serotonin (5-HT) syndrome is the most serious toxic interaction of antidepressants  but no pharmacotherapy has yet been established. In the present study  we created an animal model of the 5-HT syndrome by intraperitoneally injecting rats with clorgyline (2 mg/kg) and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP) (100 mg/kg) and evaluated the effectiveness of potent 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists and GABA-enhancing drugs  including diazepam and chlormethiazole. The rectal temperature of the rats was measured  and the noradrenaline (NA) and 5-HT levels in the anterior hypothalamus were measured by microdialysis. In the group pre-treated with saline  the rectal temperature increased to more than 40 degrees C  and all of the animals died within 90 min after administration. Pre-treatment with potent 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists prevented the development of hyperthermia and death in the rats. Pre-treatment with diazepam  10 and 20mg/kg  and chlormethiazole  50 and 100mg/kg  attenuated the development of hyperthermia. Although neither of these drugs completely prevented the rats from dying  they prolonged their survival time. Regardless of the type of therapeutic agents  the concentration of 5-HT increased to about 1100-fold the pre-administration level. The NA levels in the saline group increased to about 16-fold the pre-administration levels  but the increase was significantly lower in the rats that survived as a result of drug therapy. These results suggest that GABA-mimetic drugs may be effective against the 5-HT syndrome  although they have a somewhat weaker effect than the potent 5-HT(2A) receptor blockers  and that not only is 5-HT activity increased in the brain in the 5-HT syndrome  but the NA system is also enhanced."
"748","12620280","Neurosteroid modulation of the presynaptic NMDA receptors regulating hippocampal noradrenaline release in normal rats and those exposed prenatally to diazepam.","Prenatal exposure to diazepam (DZ)  a positive allosteric modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor complex  exerts profound effects that become more evident during puberty and in many cases are sex-specific  suggesting that such exposure interferes with the activity of steroid hormones. Apart from their well known effects on the genome  the reduced metabolites of many steroid hormones also interact directly with membrane receptors  including those for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). In this study  we compared the effects of several neurosteroids on NMDA receptors from normal rats and those exposed in utero to DZ (1.25mg/kg per day) from the 14th through the 20th day of gestation. In superfused rat hippocampal synaptosomes  activation of the NMDA receptor stimulates the basal release of [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA)  which was used in our study as an index of receptor function. [3H]NA release was evoked in a concentration-dependent manner by NMDA (100 microM) plus glycine (GLY). The maximal increase (68.23+/-3.86%) with respect to basal release was achieved with a GLY concentration of 10 microM  and the EC(50) for GLY was 0.1 microM. Release stimulated by 100 microM NMDA + 0.1 microM GLY was not modified by any of the neurosteroids tested  with the exception of pregnenolone sulfate (PREG-S)  which produced a 78.57+/-3.94% reduction in release at the maximal concentration used (0.3 microM). In synaptosomes from animals exposed in utero to DZ  the inhibitory effect of PREG-S was reduced by 46.55+/-2.33%. Given the important roles played by NMDA receptors in physiological and pathological processes within the central nervous system (CNS)  characterization of NMDA receptor modulation is an important objective. The fact that this modulation can be altered by exposure in utero to DZ indicates that the behavioral abnormalities observed in exposed animals might be partially attributed to an altered sensitivity of NMDA receptors to the modulatory effects of neurosteroids."
"749","12607222","Pharmacological characterisation of cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors in two Wistar rat lines selectively bred for high and low anxiety-related behaviour.","Two Wistar rat lines that have been selectively bred for high-anxiety-related behaviour (HAB) and low-anxiety-related behaviour (LAB) in the elevated plusmaze test may be considered as a genetically prone animal model to study the neurochemical correlates of anxiety-related behaviour. Because there are pronounced differences between the two lines both in baseline levels of open-arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze test and in sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of 1 mg/kg diazepam  we used these lines to investigate the pharmacology of the benzodiazepine binding site and the GABA binding site of cortical GABAA receptors. No difference in characteristics of flunitrazepam  zolpidem or muscimol binding to cortical GABAA receptors could be detected between the two lines. Although there was an increase in the brain concentration of the anxiolytic neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone  a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors  both in HAB and LAB animals after a forced swim stress  allopregnanolone concentrations did not differ between the two lines. Moreover  plasma dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentrations were similar in HAB and LAB animals. We conclude that anxiety-related behaviour and benzodiazepine sensitivity in these rat lines are likely to be independent of the pharmacology of cortical GABAA receptors."
"750","12606639","The role of GABAB receptors in the discriminative stimulus effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate in rats: time course and antagonism studies.","gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a neurotransmitter in brain and an emerging drug of abuse  although its mechanism of action is poorly understood. This study characterized the role of GABA(A)  GABA(B)  and other receptors in the discriminative stimulus effects of GHB. Eight rats reliably discriminated 200 mg/kg GHB from saline after a median of 35 (range: 23-41) training sessions. GHB  a metabolic precursor 1 4-butanediol (1 4-BDL)  and the GABA(B) agonist (+/-)baclofen all occasioned greater than 83% responding on the GHB lever. The onset of action was similar for GHB and 1 4-BDL; however  1 4-BDL exhibited a longer duration of action than GHB. The GHB precursor gamma-butyrolactone  the benzodiazepine diazepam  the neuroactive steroid pregnanolone  the opioid agonist morphine  and the N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist ketamine elicited substantial GHB-appropriate responding  although none occasioned greater than 66% drug-lever responding. The barbiturate pentobarbital and the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol did not occasion greater than 17% drug-lever responding at any dose tested. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil attenuated GHB-lever responding occasioned by diazepam  but not GHB. The GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP 35348 antagonized GHB-lever responding occasioned by baclofen or GHB. Small doses of the purported GHB receptor antagonist (2E)-(5-hydroxy-5 7 8 9-tetrahydro-6H-benzo[a][7]annulen-6-ylidene ethanoic acid (NCS-382) attenuated partially the effects of GHB  whereas larger doses of NCS-382 alone occasioned partial GHB-lever responding. These results implicate GABA(B) mechanisms in the discriminative stimulus effects of GHB and further suggest that the effects of 1 4-BDL under these conditions result from its conversion to GHB. That NCS-382 shares effects with GHB could explain the lack of antagonism reported for NCS-382 in some studies."
"751","12600706","Stress-induced vocalisation in adult animals. A valid model of anxiety?","The post-stimuli anticipatory vocalisations that follow stressful and painful conditions are suggested as a quantitative measure of the emotional state of fear and anxiety in animal models. Adult rats emit characteristic 22-kHz ultrasound vocalisations consisting of 20-30 kHz calls with a mean duration of 300-600 ms as response to aversive stimuli (e.g. inescapable electric footshock  acoustic or air-puff stimuli  agonistic encounter or withdrawal from treatment with drugs of abuse). The vocalisations are accompanied by defensive submissive behaviour and signal a refractory  socially withdrawn or helpless state. Furthermore  brain structures that are involved in the mediation of anxiety-like behaviour  e.g. the dorsal periaqueductal grey and cortical areas  are also important for modulation of ultrasonic vocalisation. Benzodiazepines  e.g. diazepam  inhibit shock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation although the active doses are generally close to those that produce sedation and muscle relaxation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants that preferentially enhance serotonergic neurotransmission inhibit footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation. The 5-HT(2) receptor antagonistic properties of fluoxetine may explain why only partial inhibition is achieved. The biphasic dose-response curve of the racemic drug  citalopram  may perhaps be ascribed to an attenuating effect of R-citalopram. Tricyclic antidepressants  e.g. imipramine  and antidepressants that preferentially enhance catecholaminergic neurotransmission  e.g. reboxetine and venlafaxine  are inactive. Classical antipsychotics like haloperidol have no or a weak inhibitory effect. Serotonin plays a major role in the mediation of ultrasonic vocalisation  and in particular 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2) receptors are found to have a prominent role. Different serotonergic pathways are likely to be involved in the mediation of the anxiolytic-like response  e.g. the pathway ascending from the dorsal raphe nucleus through the medial forebrain bundle to the amygdala and frontal cortex mediating conditioned/learned anxiety and another pathway ascending from the dorsal raphe nucleus to the periaqueductal grey mediating unconditioned/fight flight anxiety. Dopamine D(2) receptor agonists are potent inhibitors of footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation. The role of dopamine D(1) receptors and adrenoceptors remains to be further elucidated. Several other neurotransmitters are involved in the mediation of ultrasonic vocalisation  e.g. acetylcholine  histamine and glutamate. There is also a need for further studies of how changes in stress-axis function may modulate ultrasonic vocalisation and for studies of the effects of chronic drug treatment on ultrasonic vocalisation."

The shortening of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor currents by 2A subunit (NR2A) insertion has been proposed to delimit the critical period for experience-dependent refinement of circuits in visual cortex. In mice engineered to maintain prolonged NMDA responses by targeted deletion of NR2A  the sensitivity to monocular deprivation was surprisingly weakened but restricted to the typical critical period and delayed normally by dark rearing from birth. Orientation preference instead failed to mature  occluding further effects of dark rearing. Interestingly  a full ocular dominance plasticity (but not orientation bias) was selectively restored by enhanced inhibition  reflecting an imbalanced excitation in the absence of NR2A. Many of the downstream pathways involved in NMDA signaling are coupled to the receptor through a variety of protein-protein interactions and adaptor molecules. To further investigate a mechanistic dissociation of receptive field properties in the developing visual system  mice carrying a targeted disruption of the NR2A-associated 95-kDa postsynaptic density (PSD95) scaffolding protein were analyzed. Although the development and plasticity of ocular dominance was unaffected  orientation preference again failed to mature in these mice. Taken together  our results demonstrate that the cellular basis generating individual sensory response properties is separable in the developing neocortex."

On the other hand  no significant changes in ACh synthesizing and the hydrolyzing enzyme activities in either brain region were observed in saiboku-to-  diazepam- and combination-treated rats. These results suggest that not only is the diazepam-induced increase in tissue ACh due to the inhibition of ACh release but also that saiboku-to potentiates diazepam-induced inhibition of ACh release."

The spike AHPs showed two minima in all regular-spiking (5)  burst-firing (3) and in many fast-spiking cells (17:28). The fast component had a time-to-peak (TTP) of 1.2 +/- 0.5 ms  the slower TTP was very variable (range of 3.3-103 ms). The AHP width at half-amplitude (HW) was 12.5 +/- 5.7 ms in fast-spiking  29.3 +/- 18 ms in regular-spiking and 99.7 +/- 42 ms in burst-firing cells. Axo-axonic cells never establish autapses  and the fast-spiking variety showed narrow (HW: 3.9 +/- 0.7 ms) spike AHPs with only one AHP minimum (TTP: 0.9 +/- 0.1 ms). When challenged with GABA(A) receptor modulators  spike AHPs in basket and bistratified cells were enhanced by zolpidem (HW by 18.4 +/- 6.2 % in 10:15 cells tested)  diazepam (45.2 +/- 0.5 %  6:7)  etomidate (43.9 +/- 36 %  6:8) and pentobarbitone sodium (41 %  1:1)  and were depressed by bicuculline (-41 +/- 5.7 %  5:8) and picrotoxin (-54 %  1:1)  and the enhancement produced by zolpidem was reduced by flumazenil (-31 +/- 13 %  relative to the AHP HW during exposure to zolpidem  3:4). Neuronal excitability was modulated in parallel. The spike AHPs of three axo-axonic cells tested showed no sensitivity to etomidate  pentobarbitone or diazepam. Interneurone-to-interneurone inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs)  studied with dual intracellular recordings  had time courses resembling those of the spike AHPs. The IPSP HW was 13.4 +/- 2.8 ms in fast-spiking (n = 16) and 28.7 +/- 5.8 ms in regular-spiking/burst-firing cells (n = 6)  and the benzodiazepine1-selective modulator zolpidem strongly enhanced these IPSPs (45 +/- 28 %  n = 5). Interneurones with spike AHPs affected by the GABA(A) receptor ligands exhibited 3.8 +/- 1.9 close autaptic appositions. In three basket cells studied at the ultrastructural level 6 of 6  1 of 2 and 1 of 2 close appositions were confirmed as autapses. Therefore  in the hippocampus autaptic connections contribute to spike AHPs in many interneurones. These autapses influence neuronal firing and responses to GABA(A) receptor ligands."

Experimental studies of these affective disorders to date have largely focused on the neurotransmitter pathways with well-established pathophysiologic roles  such as serotonergic  noradrenergic  and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic systems; agents modulating the activity of these pathways are known to be clinically effective. More recently  the neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its receptor (the neurokinin-1 receptor [NK1R]) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of affective disorders  including depression. Earlier preclinical and clinical studies  though  did not provide a clear consensus on the role of SP in the regulation of affective behavior and related pathologic conditions. Recent studies in mice clearly demonstrate that both the genetic disruption and acute pharmacologic blockade of the NK1R result in marked reduction in anxiety-like behavior and stress-related responses. In parallel with these behavioral effects  physiologic changes  such as an increased firing rate of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei and a desensitization of presynaptic 5-HT1A inhibitory autoreceptors  were observed. These findings provide further evidence for the regulatory role of the SP-NK1R system in modulation of affective behavior and indicate that its effects are mediated  at least in part  via the serotonergic system. Future studies will attempt to delineate the interaction between the SP-NK1R system and various neurotransmitter pathways in greater detail and to address the specific role(s) of this system in different brain regions."

Ethanol  diazepam  and chloralhydrate significantly inhibited GLUT1 function. Erythrocyte cell lysis was evident at concentrations of 2.5% ethanol. Diazepam  chloralhydrate  and ethanol are inhibitors of GLUT1 function in vitro and might potentiate the effects of GLUT1-mediated glucose transport in patients with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

In cultured rat astrocytes  diazepam  PK11195  Ro5-4864  and the benzodiazepine binding inhibitor (DBI)  which acts on peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors  induced PTN. Clonazepam  a specific ligand of the central benzodiazepine receptor  failed to induce PTN. Nanomolar concentrations of DBI and PK11195 were sufficient to increase PTN  and diazepam effects were already observed at concentrations of 1 micromol/L. Diazepam-induced PTN was insensitive to NOS inhibition and uric acid but was blunted by MK-801  BAPTA-AM  W13  and catalase  suggesting an involvement of NMDA-receptor activation  elevation of the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration [Ca(2+)](i)  and hydrogen peroxide. Diazepam induced a plateau-like increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs)  which are both blunted by MK-801 and BAPTA-AM. The expression of functional N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors on cultured rat astrocytes was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  Western blot analysis  immunhistochemistry  and receptor autoradiography. Astroglial PTN is also found in brains from rats challenged with diazepam  indicating the in vivo relevance of the present findings. In conclusion  production of ROIs and increased PTN by benzodiazepines may alter astrocyte function and thereby contribute to the precipitation of HE episodes."

In the arcuate nucleus  NPY-expressing neurones were mostly found in the inner zone in close proximity of the third ventricle. ODN at the dose of 0.1 microg/kg induced a significant decrease of 17.4% in NPY mRNA expression  while the depressing effect was more marked (31.4%) with the highest dose of ODN (1 microg/kg). POMC-expressing neurones were more laterally located in the arcuate nucleus. Administration of ODN at 0.1 microg/kg and 1 microg/kg doses induced increases of 33.5% and 27.4% in POMC mRNA expression  respectively. Labelling obtained with the CRH cRNA probe was essentially distributed throughout the medial parvocellular area of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. ODN  at doses of 0.1 and 1 microg/kg  resulted in 17.8% and 32.8% decreases in CRH mRNA expression  respectively. The present data suggest that ODN might exert its anorexigenic effect by increasing mRNA expression of POMC and decreasing mRNA expression of NPY in the arcuate nucleus."

Immobilization stress (40 min) led to a tetrodotoxin-reversible increase in dialysate lactate levels. Diazepam (1.0 mg/kg  i.p.) reduced the ability of immobilization stress to increase lactate levels. Furthermore  the attenuation of the immobilization stress-induced increase of lactate levels by diazepam was antagonized by pretreatment with flumazenil (15 mg/kg  i.p.)  a selective antagonist at benzodiazepine receptors. These findings suggest that immobilization stress increases lactate levels in rat basolateral amygdaloid nuclei  which is attenuated by stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors."

We have found that the selective anxiolytic gidazepam has a higher affinity for CNS MBRs as compared to central benzodiazepine receptors. The ability of gidazepam to bind to MBRs probably underlies a wide spectrum of its pharmacological effects. We have studied affinities of gidazepam analogs for CNS MBRs in search for the ligands possessing higher affinity and selectivity. The experiments were carried out with male Wistar rats weighing between 200-220 g. Affinities of the investigated compounds were assessed on their ability to displace radioligand Ro5-4864 from its specific binding sites on MBRs of rat brain. Within the series of tested compounds three substances comparable on affinity with Ro5-4864 were found. Experimental results have shown that the presence of chlorine atom in o-position of 5-phenyl substituent leads to a 10 to 15-fold increase in affinity for CNS MBRs. We have also found that the essential contribution in affinity of the investigated series is brought by lipophilicity of substituent in IN-position. Our data may be useful in design and synthesis of novel potent selectively acting ligands of CNS MBRs."

The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor  N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (50 mg/kg)  aggravated restraint stress effects in the elevated plus maze test  whereas the lower dose (10 mg/kg) of the drug attenuated the same. In the open field test  the restraint stress-induced (a) increased entry latency and (b) decreased ambulation and rearing were reversed by diazepam and L-arginine and L-NAME (10 mg/kg)  whereas L-NAME (50 mg/kg) aggravated restraint stress effects. The neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor  7-nitroindazole (10 and 50 mg/kg)  did not influence these restraint stress-induced behavioral changes to any significant extent. Biochemical data showed that L-NAME (10 and 50 mg/kg.) induced opposite effects on the total brain nitrate/nitrite content during restraint stress. The results indicate a possible involvement of NO in stress-induced neurobehavioral effects."

Moreover  the in vivo pharmacological properties of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 have not been thoroughly examined. In the present study  we examined the pharmacological profile of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 binding in the monkey brain using positron emission tomography (PET). [(11)C]Ro15-4513 showed relatively high accumulation in the anterior cingulate cortex  hippocampus  and insular cortex  with the lowest uptake being observed in the pons. Accumulation in the cerebral cortex was significantly diminished by the BZ antagonist flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg  i.v.)  but not that in the pons. Using the pons as a reference region  the specific binding of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 in most of the cerebral cortex including the limbic regions clearly revealed two different affinity sites. On the other hand  specific binding in the occipital cortex and cerebellum showed only a low affinity site. Zolpidem with affinity for alpha1  alpha2  and alpha3 subunits of GABA(A)/BZ receptor fully inhibited [(11)C]Ro15-4513 binding in the occipital cortex and cerebellum  while only about 23% of the binding was blocked in the anterior cingulate cortex. Diazepam with affinity for alpha1  alpha2  alpha3  and alpha5 subunits inhibited the binding in all brain regions. Since Ro15-4513 has relatively high affinity for the alpha5 subunit in vitro  these in vivo bindings of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 can be interpreted as the relatively high accumulation in the fronto-temporal limbic regions representing binding to the GABA(A)/BZ receptor alpha5 subunit."
"763","12488536","Withdrawal from chronic intermittent ethanol treatment changes subunit composition, reduces synaptic function, and decreases behavioral responses to positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors.","One of the pharmacological targets of ethanol is the GABAA receptor (GABAR)  whose function and expression are altered after chronic administration of ethanol. The details of the changes differ between experimental models. In the chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) model for alcohol dependence  rats are exposed to intermittent episodes of intoxicating ethanol and withdrawal  leading to a kindling-like state of behavioral excitability. This is accompanied by presumably causal changes in GABAR expression and physiology. The present study investigates further the effect of CIE on GABAR function and expression. CIE is validated as a model for human alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) by demonstrating increased level of anxiety; diazepam improved performance in the test. In addition  CIE rats showed remarkably reduced hypnotic response to a benzodiazepine and a steroid anesthetic  reduced sensitivity to a barbiturate  but not propofol. Immunoblotting revealed decrease in alpha1 and delta expression and increase in gamma2 and alpha4 subunits in hippocampus of CIE rats  confirmed by an increase in diazepam-insensitive binding for ethyl-8-azido-5 6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo(1 5-alpha)(1 4)benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro15-4513). Elevated mRNA levels were shown for the gamma2S and gamma1 subunits. Recordings in hippocampal slices from CIE rats revealed that the decay time of GABAR-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal cells was decreased  and potentiation of mIPCSs by positive modulators of GABAR was also reduced compared with control rats. However  mIPSC potentiation by the alpha4-preferring benzodiazepine ligands bretazenil and Ro15-4513 was maintained  and increased  respectively. These data suggest that specific alterations in GABAR occur after CIE and may underlie the development of hyperexcitability and ethanol dependence."

Pharmacological parameters were obtained from homogenate binding studies which utilised the 'central-type' benzodiazepine ligands [3H]diazepam and [3H]flunitrazepam  and from the GABA activation of [3H]diazepam binding. It was found that the two radioligands behaved differently during development. The affinity of [3H]flunitrazepam for its binding site did not vary significantly between preparations  whereas the [3H]diazepam K(D) showed marked regional and developmental variations: infant tissues showed a distinctly lower affinity than adults for this ligand. The density of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites increased approximately 35% during the third trimester to reach adult levels by term  whereas [3H]diazepam binding capacity declined slightly but steadily throughout development. The GABA activation of [3H]diazepam binding was less efficient early in the trimester  in that the affinity of the agonist was significantly lower  though it rose to adult levels by term. The strength of the enhancement response increased to adult levels over the same time-frame. The results strongly suggest that the subunit composition of cortical GABA(A) sites changes significantly during this important developmental stage."

NO generation was measured directly in the brain of a PTZ-induced mouse in vivo by an L-band EPR spectrometer. An elevation in NO production in the brain was observed during convulsions  and more NO was generated in the tonic seizure vs. the clonic seizure. NO content in several brain tissues (including the cerebral cortex (CR)  cerebellum (CL)  olfactory bulb (OB)  hippocampus (HI)  and hypothalamus (HT)) of PTZ-doped rats was analyzed quantitatively ex vivo by X-band EPR. To test the involvement of NO in seizure development  pharmacological analyses were performed using the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA)  N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA)  and 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole (3Br-7NI). All of these inhibitors suppressed the convulsions  holding them at the clonic level  and prevented development of a tonic convulsion in rats doped with up to 80 mg/kg PTZ. 3Br-7NI completely inhibited NO production  but L-NNA and L-NMMA showed only 70% inhibition of NO production in PTZ-doped rats. In order to examine the contributions of NO in convulsions  rats were treated with anticonvulsants (phenytoin and diazepam) before PTZ treatment. Both drugs completely suppressed tonic convulsion in PTZ-doped rats at doses up to 80 mg/kg  but NO levels were similar to those detected in a clonic convulsion. These results support the notion that NO does not directly induce a clonic convulsion  but may be generated as a consequence of onset of seizure."

It has been suggested that zolpidem may produce less memory and cognitive impairment than benzodiazepines (BZs) due to its low binding affinity for BZ receptor subtypes found in areas of the brain that are involved in learning and memory  in particular the hippocampus. A novel protocol for inducing long-term synaptic depression through activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors in the hippocampal slices has been recently reported. The authors used the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices to compare the effects of classic BZs  which bind equipotently to BZ1 and BZ2 sites  and of nonbenzodiazepine zolpidem  which binds preferentially to the BZ1 sites of GABA(A) receptors  on the GABA(A)-induced long-term depression (LTD)  a possible cellular mechanism for their different cognition-impairment profile. Extracellular recordings were made in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of rat hippocampal slices following orthodromic stimulation of Schaffer collateral fibres in stratum radiatum (0.01 Hz). It was observed that diazepam and cholordiazepoxide at concentrations of 10 and 20 microM  which did not have any effect themselves on the population spike  potentiate the ability of muscimol to induce LTD  whereas zolpidem at concentrations of 10 and 20 microM failed to potentiate muscimol-induced LTD. The results suggest that the potentiation of muscimol-induced LTD by diazepam or chlordiazepoxide and the lack of this effect by zolpidem may explain their different cognition impairment profiles."

In situ hybridization was carried out to localize PRAX-1 mRNA in the rat brain and revealed a high expression of the transcript in limbic structures such as the CA1 region of the hippocampus  as well as the dentate gyrus  septum  amygdala  and the islands of Calleja. A dense hybridization signal was also observed in the nucleus accumbens  caudate nucleus  olfactory tubercle  pineal gland  and cerebellar cortex. PRAX-1 mRNA expression was largely neuronal; it colocalized with neuron-specific enolase but not glial fibrillary acidic protein. Long-term treatments (21 days) with the neuroleptic haloperidol increased PRAX-1 mRNA expression only in the dentate gyrus  whereas anxiolytic/anticonvulsant diazepam had no effect in any of the hippocampal region studied. Repeated electroconvulsive shock administration significantly enhanced PRAX1 expression in the CA1 subfield and dentate gyrus. Several classes of antidepressant treatment  including serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine)  mixed serotonin- and norepinephrine-uptake inhibitor (imipramine)  and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (iproniazid and tranylcypromine)  shared this effect.

Needless to say  this suggestion created opposition  but we did not abandon the original idea  in fact  as shown in this review  there is now universal agreement with our hypothesis on the mode of action of benzodiazepines. Hence  this review deals with the allosteric modulation of GABA(A) receptors by benzodiazepines  the role of GABA(A) receptors and benzodiazepine structure diversities in this modulation  and describes the results of our attempts to establish a benzodiazepine (imidazenil) devoid of tolerance  withdrawal symptoms  and changes in the expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits during tolerance.

For up to 30 min after administration  the sedative effect interfered with the anxiolytic effect  thus the results of the anxiolytic effect were not interpretable. From 30 min to 60 min after administration  this interference disappeared  the cerebral level of benzodiazepines was stable (the brain elimination of diazepam was compensated for by the appearance of desmethyldiazepam followed by oxazepam) but the anxiolytic effect decreased dramatically in all the tests with diazepam 1 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg. The acute tolerance to benzodiazepines and the difference of affinity for subtypes of GABA(A) receptors between diazepam  desmethyldiazepam  oxazepam could explain this result."
"775","12399076","Transient increase of P-glycoprotein expression in endothelium and parenchyma of limbic brain regions in the kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy.","Several recent studies have shown that the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (PGP) is over-expressed in endothelial cells from brain blood vessels of patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)  suggesting that altered drug permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may be involved in pharmacoresistance to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Furthermore  over-expression of PGP has been found in astrocytes of epileptogenic tissue. However  it is not known in which regions of the temporal lobe PGP over-expression occurs and whether the over-expression is a result of uncontrolled seizures  of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy  or of chronic administration of AEDs. In the present study  we used the rat kainate model of TLE to study the time-course of PGP expression in capillary endothelium and parenchyma of the hippocampus and several other limbic brain regions thought to be involved in TLE. Kainate was administered at a dose which produced a generalized convulsive status epilepticus (SE)  which was limited to a duration of 90 min by diazepam. PGP was detected by immunohistochemistry either 24 h or 10 days after SE  using a monoclonal PGP antibody. In both kainate-treated rats and controls  PGP staining was observed mainly in microvessel endothelial cells and  to a much lesser extent  in parenchymal cells. Twenty-four hours after SE  significant increases in PGP expression were determined in endothelial cells of the dentate gyrus and in parenchymal cells of the CA1 and CA3 sectors of the hippocampus. Furthermore  increased PGP expression was observed in the amygdala  piriform  and parietal cortex  but not in the substantia nigra. Ten days after the kainate-induced SE  except for an increase in parenchymal PGP expression in the dentate hilus and CA1 sector  no significant differences to controls were determined  indicating that most PGP increases seen 24 h after SE were only transient. The data indicate that PGP over-expression is a transient result of seizures and occurs in several regions of the temporal lobe. Seizure-induced over-expression of PGP in capillary endothelial cells of the BBB is likely to reduce the penetration of AEDs into brain parenchyma  which could explain the drug-refractoriness of seizures in TLE."

The rat brains were perfused with Krebs-bicarbonate buffer containing test compounds in the absence or presence of a specific P-glycoprotein inhibitor (GF-120918). Brain samples were collected after perfusion and processed by a capillary depletion method. After liquid phase extraction with acetonitrile  samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Linear uptake kinetics of DADLE and its cyclic prodrugs was observed within the range of 60 to 240 s of perfusion. The apparent permeability coefficient (P(app)) of DADLE across the BBB was very low (&lt;10(-7) cm/s)  probably due to its unfavorable physicochemical properties (e.g.  charge  hydrophilicity  and high hydrogen-bonding potential). All three cyclic prodrugs  however  also exhibited low membrane permeation (P(app) &lt;10(-7) cm/s) in spite of their more favorable physicochemical properties (e.g.  no charge  high hydrophobicity  and low hydrogen-bonding potential).

In contrast  GF-120918 had no effect on the P(app) value of DADLE. In addition  the observed bioconversions of the prodrugs to DADLE in the rat brains after 240-s perfusion were very low (5.1% from AOA-DADLE  0.6% from CA-DADLE  and 0.2% from OMCA-DADLE)  which was consistent with the in vitro bioconversion rates determined previously in rat brain homogenates."

For responses elicited by brief pulses of 20 microM GABA  both the AAS and the BZ site compounds significantly increased the peak current amplitudes and total charge transfer  although 17alpha-MeT was an appreciably weaker agonist than either diazepam or zolpidem at alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2L) receptors. Neither class of modulator enhanced peak current amplitudes for responses elicited by mM concentrations of GABA. BZ site compounds altered time constants of deactivation  desensitization  and recovery from desensitization  however 17alpha-MeT had no overall effect on these parameters. Experiments in which 17alpha-MeT and BZ site ligands were applied concomitantly indicated that potentiation elicited by 17alpha-MeT and zolpidem were additive and that potentiation by 17alpha-MeT could be elicited in the presence of concentrations of flumazenil that blocked BZ potentiation. Finally  kinetic modeling suggests that while effects of 17alpha-MeT can be simulated by altering receptor affinity  the data for these alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2L) receptors were best fitted by simulations in which 17alpha-MeT increases transitions into the singly liganded open state. Taken together  our results suggest that 17alpha-MeT does not act at the high-affinity BZ site  but may elicit some of its effects at the low affinity BZ site or at a novel site."

Few studies have been made  however  about the aversion to food  which is an important signal for animals to protect them from poison that usually has a bitter taste and causes an aversive sensation. We recently suggested that diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) was released in the brain after stimulation by an aversive taste and might be involved in the aversive sensations of taste. In this review we describe the studies on aversive sensation after eating and propose a novel concept that food aversion may be divided into aversion and rejection. Furthermore  we suggest that DBI is involved in aversion."
"782","12169108","Long-lasting modification of intrinsic discharge properties in subicular neurons following status epilepticus.","A single episode of status epilepticus (SE) induces neuropathological changes in the brain that may lead to the development of a permanent epileptic condition. Most studies of this plasticity have focused on the hippocampus  where both synaptic function and intrinsic neuronal excitability have been shown to be persistently modified by SE. However  many other brain structures are activated during SE and may also be involved in the subsequent epileptogenic process. Here we have investigated whether SE  induced in rats with pilocarpine and terminated after 40 min with diazepam  persistently modifies the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the subiculum. Subicular slices were prepared from control and SE-experienced rats (2-5 weeks after SE). In the control group  only 4% of the neurons fired bursts in response to intrasomatic  threshold-straddling depolarizing current pulses (low-threshold bursters). The remaining neurons either fired bursts in response to strong (3x threshold) depolarizations (35%; high-threshold bursters) or fired in a completely regular mode (61%; nonbursters). In the SE-experienced group  the fractions of low- and high-threshold bursters markedly increased to 29% and 53%  respectively. This change in firing behaviour was associated with a marked increase in the size of the spike after depolarization  particularly in low-threshold bursters. Experimental suppression of Ca2+ currents selectively blocked low-threshold bursting but did not affect high-threshold bursting  suggesting that a dual Ca2+- dependent and Ca2+- independent mechanism controls bursting in these neurons. The persistent up-regulation of intrinsic bursting in the subiculum  in concert with similar changes in the hippocampus  undoubtedly contributes to epileptogenesis following pilocarpine-induced SE."

"784","12145412","Prenatal diazepam exposure functionally alters the GABA(A) receptor that modulates [3H]noradrenaline release from rat hippocampal synaptosomes.","In rats  exposure to diazepam (DZ) during the last week of gestation is associated with behavioral alterations (in some cases sexually dimorphic) that appear when the animals reach adulthood. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of prenatal DZ exposure on the function of the gamma-aminobutyric (GABA)(A) receptor complex. The method used - perfusion of rat hippocampal nerve terminals labeled with [3H]noradrenaline (NA) - allowed us to evaluate the effects of DZ on a specific native GABA(A) receptor subtype which is located on hippocampal noradrenergic nerve endings and mediates the release of NA. Muscimol stimulated synaptosomal release of [3H]NA in a concentration-dependent manner; maximal stimulation (50%) was achieved with a concentration of 30 microM  and the ED(50) was 1.7 microM. The effect of muscimol was potentiated by the positive allosteric modulators DZ and 3alpha-pregnan-5alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha 5alpha-P; allopregnanolone)  which displayed similar maximal effects and affinities. In the presence of DZ (0.1 microM)  muscimol stimulated the release of [3H]NA with an ED(50) of 0.5 microM; in the presence of 3alpha 5alpha-P (0.1 microM)  the ED(50) of muscimol was 0.3 microM. Prenatal DZ exposure did not modify the concentration-effect curve for muscimol  but it did abolish the potentiating effects of DZ and 3alpha 5alpha-P. These findings demonstrate that prenatal exposure to DZ produces functional modifications of the GABA(A) receptor subtype we investigated. This effect may be related to the relative contributions of the various protein subunits that compose the GABA(A) receptor complex. Exposure to DZ while the GABA(A) receptors are developing might influence the expression of these subunits  giving rise to a receptor that can be activated by muscimol but is not susceptible to allosteric modulation by DZ or 3alpha 5alpha-P."

We investigated the expression and processing of caspases 6 and 7  putative executioner caspases. Brief limbic seizures were evoked by intraamygdala kainic acid to elicit unilateral death of target hippocampal CA3 neurons in the rat. Seizures rapidly induced cleavage of constitutively expressed caspase-6  followed by elevated VEIDase activity and the proteolysis of lamin A. Neuronal caspase-6 immunoreactivity was markedly upregulated within cortex and hippocampus in relation to bursts of polyspike paroxysmal discharges. In contrast  while caspase-7 expression also increased within cortical and hippocampal neuronal populations in response to the same seizure patterns  caspase-7 was not proteolytically activated. These data highlight differences in expression and activation of caspases 6 and 7 in response to identifiable seizure patterns  focusing potential therapeutic targets for neuroprotection in epilepsy."

It was demonstrated that the reactivity of benzodiazepine receptors underlies the individual sensitivity to pentylenetetrazole. The animals with higher sensitivity were characterized by more intensive reaction than the control and resistant animals  i.e.  by an decrease in the receptors density (the initial receptors density being equal in the sensitive  resistant  and control animals). Daily injections of a subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole during 24 days increase the animal sensitivity to this substance  and this was accompanied by an increase in the reactivity of benzodiasepine receptors. Later on  the produced high sensitivity became somewhat lower but persisted for 6 months. The receptors density in this period reduced almost by half. In sensitive rats  a single low dose of pentylenetetrazole injected 6 months after treatment increased the density of benzodiazepine receptors. The age-matched controls  the same acute dose of pentylenetetrazole decreased both the receptor density and affinity of their binding. It is suggested that the increase in reactivity of benzodiazepine receptors is actualized via the intracellular metabotropic feedback mechanism."

Flunitrazepam (1 mg/kg)  an agonist for central benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors  completely abolished the CES-induced elevation of cerebral DBI contents and its mRNA expressions.

Because serotonin (5-HT) is said to be involved in both anxiety and alcohol dependence  in the present study the effect of acute ethanol administration on basal 5-HT release of the medial prefrontal cortex and its effect on 5-HT release in rats submitted to an animal model of anxiety  the elevated plus maze test  were detected in two rat strains showing a different anxiety-related behavior. Ethanol had an anxiolytic-like effect and induced an increase of basal 5-HT release in the medial prefrontal cortex in the home cage in the less anxious Wistar-Harlan rats. Both effects were not seen in the more anxious Wistar-BgVV rats. The exposure to the elevated plus maze test induced an increase of extracellular 5-HT in the more anxious Wistar-BgVV rats but not in the less anxious Wistar-Harlan rats. Ethanol did not change 5-HT release during the elevated plus maze test in both rat strains. Thus  the anxiolytic-like effect of ethanol in Wistar-Harlan rats was not primarily associated with a decrease of 5-HT release in the prefrontal cortex as it is seen with other anxiolytic agents like diazepam."

However  evidence is accumulating that measures obtained from different anxiety tasks may reflect different aspects of anxiety-like behaviour in animals. We therefore tested mice overproducing corticotropin-releasing hormone in a battery of paradigms  studying spontaneous behaviour after a mild stressor  tasks of innate anxiety-like behaviour (light-dark box)  lick suppression (Vogel conflict)  conditioned fear  and forced swimming. Exploratory behaviour was studied in a 16-hole board task. Furthermore  pain threshold  water intake  locomotor activity and sensorimotor learning/co-ordination were tested to control for confounding factors. In line with previous findings  increased anxiety-like behaviour of transgenic mice was observed in the light-dark box paradigm. However  no differences were seen in the conflict paradigm. Conditioned fear was decreased 1 h but not 24 h after conditioning in transgenic mice  and immobility was decreased [corrected] in forced swimming in corticotropin-releasing hormone overexpressors. Locomotor activity in a novel open field and on the hole board was reduced in transgenics. Exploratory behaviour (hole pokes) was reduced during initial exploration of an unfamiliar hole board. Moreover  sensorimotor performance on a rotorod was impaired  and water intake was reduced in corticotropin-releasing hormone overproducing mice  while no changes were seen in nociception. No differences in locomotor activity were seen in a second group of mice  tested in a familiar open field. When these animals were challenged with diazepam  transgenic mice were less susceptible to the sedative effects of the drug on locomotor activity. These data suggest that corticotropin-releasing hormone overproduction leads to specific effects in a subset of anxiety paradigms  and that these transgenic mice suffer from a motor deficit in addition to altered anxiety-like behaviour/arousal."
"791","12097476","Absence of long-term depression in the visual cortex of glutamic Acid decarboxylase-65 knock-out mice.","Long-term depression (LTD) is widely considered a mechanism for experience-induced synaptic weakening in the brain. Recent in vivo studies on glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD 65 (-/-)] knock-out mice indicates that GABAergic synaptic inhibition is also required for the normal weakening of deprived inputs in the visual cortex. To better understand how GABAergic inhibition might control plasticity  we assessed the status of synaptic inhibition and LTD in visual cortical slices of GAD 65 knock-out mice. We found the following: (1) the efficacy of GABAergic synapses during repetitive activation is reduced in GAD 65 (-/-) mice; (2) the induction of LTD is impaired in the visual cortex of GAD 65 (-/-) mice; and (3) chronic  but not acute  treatment with the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam restores LTD in GAD 65 (-/-) mice. These results suggest that a certain inhibitory tone is required for the induction of LTD in visual cortex. We propose that the lack of visual cortical LTD in GAD 65 (-/-) may account for the lack of experience-dependent plasticity in these mice."

In this model  we tested whether antidepressants (fluoxetine and bupropion)  anxiolytics (diazepam and buspirone) or the novel nonpeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) type-1 receptor (CRH-R1) antagonist  antalarmin  modify these responses. Fluoxetine  bupropion  diazepam and antalarmin all suppressed stress-induced gastric ulceration in male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to four hours of plain immobilization. Antalarmin produced the most pronounced anti-ulcer effect and additionally suppressed the stress-induced colonic hypermotility  mucin depletion  autonomic hyperarousal and struggling behavior. Intraperitoneal CRH administration reproduced the intestinal but not the gastric responses to stress while vagotomy antagonized the stress-induced gastric ulceration but not the intestinal responses. We conclude that brain CRH-R1 and vagal pathways are essential for gastric ulceration to occur in response to stress and that peripheral CRH-R1 mediates colonic hypermotility and mucin depletion in this model. Nonpeptide CRH-R1 antagonists may therefore be prophylactic against stress ulcer in the critically ill and therapeutic for other pathogenetically related gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer disease and irritable bowel syndrome."

"794","12049802","Effects of antiepileptic drugs on extracellular pH regulation in the hippocampal CA1 region in vivo.","Intracellular and extracellular pH are known to influence neuronal activity and may play a role in seizure termination. In the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 region of the hippocampus in the urethane anesthetized adult rat  there is an initial alkalinization in response to stimulus trains administered to the contralateral CA3 region. This is followed by an acidification that peaks after termination of the afterdischarge. Initial experiments demonstrated that the peak level of acidification correlated with the duration of the afterdischarge  but that the peak level of alkalinization did not. The effects of several antiepileptic drugs on the initial alkalinization were determined. Systemic administration of acetazolamide (50 mg/kg  n=4) and topiramate (45 mg/kg  n=7) and local administration of benzolamide (n=3)  all of which inhibit carbonic anhydrase  decreased the initial alkalinization that occurs during the stimulus train. Diazepam (3 mg/kg  n=5) and phenobarbital (60 mg/kg  n=6)  agonists at the GABA(A) receptor complex  increased the initial alkalinization  while sodium channel blockers phenytoin (80 mg/kg  n=5) and carbamazepine (50 mg/kg  n=5) had no significant effect. The data suggest that the alkalinization in CA1 in vivo is predominantly regulated through activity of the GABA(A) receptor  rather than through activation of glutamatergic receptors. The change in alkalinization does not appear to be related to the mechanism of the antiepileptic effect of the drugs that were tested."

The major metabolite of cis-3-pinanone in each P450 system and in brain of the i.p.-treated mouse in quantitative studies was 2-hydroxy-cis-3-pinanone  and two minor metabolites were hydroxypinanones other than 2-hydroxy-trans-3-pinanone and 4S-hydroxy-cis-3-pinanone. The urine from oral cis-3-pinanone treatment examined on a qualitative basis contained conjugates of metabolites observed in the microsomal systems plus 2 10-dehydro-3-pinanone. 4. Trans-3-pinanone was metabolized more slowly than the cis-isomer in each system to give hydroxy derivatives different than those derived from cis-3-pinanone. 5.

Autoradiographic procedures were introduced in these advanced culture technique and employed [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 in the absence and presence of 10 microM diazepam to visualize all benzodiazepine (BZD) and diazepam-insensitive (DIS) binding sites  respectively. Since expression of the alpha6 subunit variant of the GABA(A)/BZD receptor is restricted to the cerebellar granule cells and the BZD receptor agonist diazepam has very low affinity for this subunit  changes in DIS [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites during cultivation time can be attributed to changes in alpha6 subunit expression. A time-dependent development of total and DIS [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites were observed in the culture with a trend towards an increase in GABA(A) receptor alpha6 subunit levels during the first week. These findings suggest that explant preparations can be used to examine morphological changes in rat cerebellar slices.

Its wide-spread distribution in non-neural tissues outside the brain suggests that DBI has various functions other than GABA-mediated neurotransmission. Since DBI is identical with the acyl-CoA binding protein  which has the ability to bind long chain acyl-CoA esters  the major function of DBI may possibly be related to lipid metabolism. This idea was supported by our previous study showing the consistent coexpression of DBI and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) in epithelia throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The present histochemical study focused on the distribution of DBI in neural tissues  and revealed a definite existence of DBI in non-neuronal supporting cells in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the brain  intense immunoreactivity for DBI was detected in the cerebellar Bergmann glia  olfactory ensheathing glia  subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus  and retinal Muller cells. In the peripheral nervous system  satellite cells in sensory/autonomic ganglia  Schwann cells  and sustentacular cells in the adrenal medulla were immunoreactive to a DBI antibody. Moreover  the colocalization of DPI and brain-type FABP (B-FABP) was observed in most of the non-neuronal supporting cells mentioned above  indicating that DBI and B-FABP are cooperatively involved in the energy metabolism of astrocytes and related cells  which are thought to support neuronal development and functions."

KCC2  is exclusively expressed in neurons where it is thought to drive intracellular Cl- to low concentrations and shift the reversal potential for Cl- conductances such as GABA(A) or glycine receptor channels  thus participating in the postnatal development of inhibitory mechanisms in the brain. Indeed  expression of the cotransporter is low at birth and increases postnatally  at a time when the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons decreases and gamma-aminobutyric acid switches its effect from excitatory to inhibitory. To assert the significance of KCC2 in neuronal function  we disrupted the mouse gene encoding this neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter. We demonstrate that animals deficient in KCC2 exhibit frequent generalized seizures and die shortly after birth. We also show upregulation of Fos  the product of the immediate early gene c-fos  and the significant loss of parvalbumin-positive interneurons  both indicative of brain injury. The regions most affected are the hippocampus and temporal and entorhinal cortices. Extracellular field potential measurements in the CA1 hippocampus exhibited hyperexcitability. Application of picrotoxin  a blocker of the GABA(A) receptor  further increased hyperexcitability in homozygous hippocampal sections. Pharmacological treatment of pups showed that diazepam relieved the seizures while phenytoin prevented them between postnatal ages P4-P12. Finally  we demonstrate that adult heterozygote animals show increased susceptibility for epileptic seizure and increased resistance to the anticonvulsant effect of propofol. Taken together  these results indicate that KCC2 plays an important role in controlling CNS excitability during both postnatal development and adult life."

AKR1C1 efficiently reduced 3alpha 5alpha-THP  5alpha-DHP and progesterone to their 20alpha-hydroxy metabolites  and slowly converted 5alpha-DHDOC to 3alpha 5alpha-THDOC. AKR1C2 exhibited low 20-ketoreductase activity for 3alpha 5alpha-THP and moderate 3-ketoreductase activity for 5alpha-DHP and 5alpha-DHDOC. 3alpha 5alpha-THDOC was not reduced by the two isoenzymes. No significant activity for the steroids was detected with AKR1C3. The results suggest that AKR1C2 is involved in the neurosteroid synthesis  but AKR1C1 decreases the neurosteroid concentrations in human brain by inactivating 3alpha 5alpha-THP and eliminating the precursors from the synthetic pathways. In addition  we found that the several benzodiazepines inhibited the three isoenzymes noncompetitively with respect to the substrate.

The molecular mechanism underlying MKC-242-induced potentiation of this phase shift  however  has not yet been elucidated. We examined the effects of MKC-242 on light-induced mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of mice. MKC-242 (5 mg kg(-1)  i.p.) potentiated light-induced mPer1 and mPer2 expression in the SCN of mice housed in constant darkness for 2 days  when mRNA levels were observed 3 hr after light-exposure. More potentiating action of MKC-242 on mPer2 expression in the SCN was observed in mice housed in constant darkness for 9-10 days. This facilitatory action of MKC-242 on mPer1 expression was antagonized by WAY100635  a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor blocker  indicating that MKC-242 activated 5-HT(1A) receptors. Other drugs such as 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (10 mg kg(-1)  i.p.)  paroxetine (10 mg kg(-1)  i.p.)  buspirone (10 mg kg(-1)  i.p.)  and diazepam (10 mg kg(-1)  i.p.) did not display a potentiating action on light-induced mPer1 and mPer2 expression in the SCN. In the behavioral experiments  we found that MKC-242 (5 mg kg(-1)  i.p.) potentiated light-induced phase delays of free-running rhythm in mice.

We then tested the capacity of 3-PBC to block alcohol-maintained responding in the ventral pallidum (VP)  a novel alcohol reward substrate  which primarily expresses the alpha1-receptor isoform. Our results demonstrated that bilateral microinfusion of 3-PBC (0.5-40 microg) in the anterior and medial VP produced marked reductions in alcohol-maintained responding in a genetically selected rodent model of alcohol drinking. The VP infusions showed both neuroanatomical and reinforcer specificity because no effects were seen in sites dorsal to the VP (e.g.  nucleus accumbens  caudate putamen). The saccharin-maintained responding was reduced only with the highest dose (40 microg). Parenteral injections of 3-PBC (1-20 mg/kg) also showed a similar selectivity on alcohol-maintained responding. Complementary in vitro studies revealed that 3-PBC exhibited a low partial agonist efficacy profile at recombinant diazepam-sensitive receptors (e.g.  alpha1beta3gamma2  alpha2beta3gamma  and alpha3beta3gamma2). The selective suppression of 3-PBC on alcohol-maintained responding after central and parenteral administrations  together with its low-efficacy agonist profile  suggest that the reduction in alcohol-maintained behaviors was not attributable to a general suppression on consummatory behaviors. These results demonstrate that the alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptors in both the anterior and medial VP are important in regulating the reinforcing properties of alcohol. These receptors represent novel targets in the design and development of pharmacotherapies for alcohol-dependent subjects."

Generic physiologically based pharmacokinetic models of drug disposition.","Many in vitro data on physicochemical properties and specific absorption  distribution  metabolism  and elimination (ADME) processes are already available at early stages of drug discovery. These data about new drug candidates could be integrated/connected in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to estimate a priori the overall plasma and tissue kinetic behaviors under in vivo conditions. The objective of the present study was to illustrate that generic PBPK models integrating such data can be developed in drug discovery prior to any in vivo studies. This approach was illustrated with three example compounds  including two lipophilic bases (diazepam  propranolol) and one neutral more hydrophilic drug (ethoxybenzamide). Distribution and liver metabolism were the processes integrated in the generic rat PBPK models of disposition. Tissue:plasma partition coefficients (P(t:p)s) used for description of distribution were estimated from established tissue composition-based equations  which need only in vitro data on drug lipophilicity and plasma protein binding as sole input parameters. Furthermore  data on intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) determined in vitro with hepatocytes were scaled to the in vivo situation to estimate hepatic metabolic clearance. These prediction approaches were both incorporated in the PBPK models to enable automated estimation of distribution and liver metabolism for each drug studied. The generic PBPK models suggested can simulate a priori concentration-time profiles of plasma and several tissues after intravenous administrations to rat. The results indicate that most of the simulated concentration-time profiles of plasma and 10 tissues are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental data determined in vivo (less than a factor of two). However  some more relevant deviations were observed for specific tissues (brain and gut for diazepam; liver and gut for ethoxybenzamide; lung for propranolol) because of important ADME processes were probably neglected in the PBPK models of these drugs. In this context  generic PBPK models were also used for mechanistic evaluations of pharmacokinetics for generating research hypotheses to understand these deviations. Overall  the present generic and integrative PBPK approach of drug disposition suggested as a tool for a priori simulations and mechanistic evaluations of pharmacokinetics has the potential to improve the selection and optimization of new drug candidates."

[(3)H]Ro 15-4513 binding to benzodiazepine sites was increased in delta(-/-) animals  partly due to an increment of diazepam-insensitive receptors  indicating an augmented forebrain assembly of gamma 2 subunits with alpha 4 subunits. In the western blots of forebrain membranes of delta(-/-) animals  the level of gamma 2 subunit was increased and that of alpha 4 decreased  while the level of alpha1 subunits remained unchanged. In the delta(-/-) forebrains  the remaining alpha 4 subunits were associated more often with gamma 2 subunits  since there was an increase in the alpha 4 subunit level immunoprecipitated by the gamma 2 subunit antibody. The pharmacological properties of t-butylbicyclophosphoro[(35)S]thionate binding to the integral ion-channel sites were slightly altered in the forebrain and cerebellum  consistent with elevated levels of alpha 4 gamma 2 and alpha 6 gamma 2 subunit-containing receptors  respectively.The altered pharmacology of forebrain GABA(A) receptors and the decrease of the alpha 4 subunit level in delta subunit-deficient mice suggest that the delta subunit preferentially assembles with the alpha 4 subunit. The delta subunit seems to interfere with the co-assembly of alpha 4 and gamma 2 subunits and  therefore  in its absence  the gamma 2 subunit is recruited into a larger population of alpha 4 subunit-containing functional receptors. These results support the idea of subunit competition during the assembly of native GABA(A) receptors."

Characterization in rodent models of stress-related disorders.","The present study investigated the effects of the novel corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF)(1) receptor antagonist 4-(2-chloro-4-methoxy-5-methylphenyl)-N-[(1S)-2-cyclopropyl-1-(3-fluoro-4-methylphenyl)ethyl]5-methyl-N-(2-propynyl)-1 3-thiazol-2-amine hydrochloride (SSR125543A) in a variety of rodent models of anxiety  including conflict procedures (punished drinking and four-plate)  exploration models (elevated plus-maze and light/dark)  a fear/anxiety defense test battery  and several procedures based on stress-induced changes in physiological (isolation-induced hyperthermia and tail pinch-induced cortical norepinephrine release) or behavioral (social defeat-induced anxiety  maternal separation-induced vocalization) parameters. Moreover  the effects of SSR125543A were investigated in acute (forced swimming) and chronic (chronic mild stress; CMS) models of depression. SSR125543A and the CRF(1) receptor antagonist antalarmin displayed limited efficacy in exploration-based anxiety models. In contrast  both compounds produced clear-cut anxiolytic-like activity in models involving inescapable stress  including the conflict procedures  the social defeat-induced anxiety paradigm and the defense test battery (3-30 mg/kg i.p. or p.o.). These effects paralleled those of the anxiolytic diazepam. In addition  SSR125543A and antalarmin antagonized stress-induced hyperthermia  distress vocalization  and cortical norepinephrine release. In the forced swimming test  30 mg/kg p.o. SSR125543A and 3 to 30 mg/kg p.o. antalarmin produced clear antidepressant-like effects. These latter results were strengthened by the findings from the CMS  which showed that repeated administration of 10 mg/kg i.p. SSR125543A for 30 days improved the degradation of the physical state  the reduction of body weight gain  and anxiety produced by stress. Together  these data indicate that SSR125543A shows good activity in acute and chronic tests of unavoidable stress exposure  suggesting that it may have a potential in the treatment of depression and some forms of anxiety disorders."

We show that p130 plays an important role in signaling by the type A receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Yeast twohybrid screening identified GABARAP (GABA(A) receptor-associated protein)  which is proposed to contribute to the sorting  targeting or clustering of GABA(A) receptors  as a protein that interacts with p130. Furthermore  p130 competitively inhibited the binding of the gamma2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor to GABARAP in vitro. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that the modulation of GABA-induced Cl- current by Zn2+ or diazepam  both of which act at GABA(A) receptors containing gamma subunits  is impaired in hippocampal neurons of p130 knockout mice. Moreover  behavioral analysis revealed that motor coordination was impaired and the intraperitoneal injection of diazepam induced markedly reduced sedative and antianxiety effects in the mutant mice. These results indicate that p130 is essential for the function of GABA(A) receptors  especially in response to the agents acting on a gamma2 subunit."

Tonic activation of these receptors contributes a 3-fold larger mean inhibitory conductance than GABA released synaptically by high-frequency stimulation. Tonic and spillover inhibition reduce the fraction of granule cells activated by mossy fiber input  generating an increase of coding sparseness  which is predicted to improve the information storage capacity of the cerebellum."

"808","11835681","Tissue Raman spectroscopy for the study of radiation damage: brain irradiation of mice.","Radiotherapy is routinely employed in the treatment of head and neck cancers. Acute cell death  radiation-activated chemical cascades  and the induction of genes coding for protective factors like cytokines are considered to be the major processes involved in radiation damage and repair. It should be possible to follow these processes by monitoring the biochemical interactions initiated by radiation. We have carried out Raman spectroscopy studies on tissue from mice subjected to brain irradiation to identify the biochemical changes occurring in tissue and brain as a result of radiation injury. These studies show that brain irradiation produces drastic spectral changes even in tissue far removed from the irradiation site. The changes are very similar to those produced by the stress of inoculation and restraint and the administration of an anesthetic drug. While the changes produced by stress or anesthetics last for only a short time (a few hours to 1 or 2 days)  radiation-induced changes persist even after 1 week. The spectral changes can be interpreted in terms of the observation of new spectra that are dominated by bands due to proteins. The results thus support the hypothesis that various protective factors are released throughout the body when the central nervous system (CNS) is exposed to radiation."

This led us to hypothesize that caspase-activated DNase (CAD) is involved in DNA fragmentation and apoptotic neuronal cell death following SE. The present study aimed to determine whether SE is associated with an activation of CAD  as reflected in the degradation of the CAD inhibitor  ICAD. SE was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by kainic acid (12 mg/kg i.p.) and seizures were terminated with diazepam after 2 h. At 24  48  or 72 h after SE termination  protein levels of CAD and ICAD were measured by Western blotting (after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) using specific antibodies. At 48 and 72 h after SE termination  ICAD protein levels significantly decreased (by more than 60%) in rhinal cortex and hippocampus as compared with those in the same tissue from animals not experiencing SE. No changes were detected in total CAD protein levels at any time point  resulting in an increase in the ratio of CAD to its inhibitor. The loss of ICAD following SE is indicative of a disinhibition of CAD  leading to DNA fragmentation. Consistent with this  we observed that the decrease in ICAD between 24 and 48 h was accompanied by a marked increase in DNA fragmentation. Our results support the proposal that CAD participates in caspase-3-mediated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the aftermath of SE."

The present in situ hybridization study revealed the cellular expression of DBI mRNA throughout the gastrointestinal tract of mice  showing it to be intensely expressed in the spinous layer in the stratified squamous epithelium of the oral cavity  esophagus and forestomach  in surface mucous cells in the glandular stomach  and in columnar (absorptive) cells of the intestinal villi. A precise identification of DBI-expressing cell types was confirmed immunohistochemically  although the expressing cells detectable by the two histochemical methods differed slightly in their extension. Noteworthily  DBI always coexisted with the fatty acid binding protein (FABP)  which participates in the uptake and metabolic processing of long chain fatty acids.

It consisted of four legs with four different administrations: intranasal (i.n.) placebo  4 mg diazepam i.n.  7 mg diazepam i.n. and 5 mg intravenous (i.v.) diazepam. Polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG300) was used as a vehicle in the nasal formulations to solubilize a clinically relevant dose of diazepam. Changes in N100  P200 and P300 brain event-related potentials (ERP) elicited by auditory stimulation and electroencephalographic beta-activity were used to assess effects on neurological activity.RESULTS: The mean [95% confidence intervals] differences between before and after drug administration values of P300-N100 amplitude differences were -0.9 [-6.5  4.7]  -6.4 [-10.1  -2 7]  -8.6 [-11.4  -5.8] and -9.6 [-12.1  -7.1] for placebo  4 mg i.n.  7 mg i.n. and 5 mg i.v. diazepam  respectively  indicating statistically significant drug induced effects.

Some nitrogenated compounds have been reported to coordinate with the iron atom from the heme group  thus inhibiting NOS. 1 4-Benzodiazepines are nitrogenated compounds which have many physiological effects such as antianxiety  antiepileptic  hypnotic  and muscle relaxation properties. The aim of this paper was to measure the effect of different benzodiazepines on NOS activity in pig brain extracts. Medazepam  pinazepam  diazepam  oxazepam and alprazolam competitively inhibited NOS with IC(50) in the micromolar range. Other benzodiazepines showed no effect at concentrations as high as 200 microM. Due to the structural similarity of the benzodiazepine ring nucleus with L-arginine  we propose a benzodiazepine-enzyme interaction to explain the competitive inhibitions. By comparing benzodiazepine effects and their structures  the inhibitory effect of benzodiazepines on NOS is related to the absence of substituents on N4 and to the absence of a halogen substituent on C5 phenyl group. Although benzodiazepine's inhibitions observed in this study are not in the physiological range in normal cases  these inhibitions could be significant in drug abuse situations and should be taken into account for the rational design of drugs which specifically inhibit NOS."

The [(3)H]5-HT outflow evoked at 10 Hz was increased up to +30% by CCK(4) 300-1000 nM  the effect being prevented by the CCK(B) receptor antagonist GV 150013  3 nM. The limited sensitivity to CCK(4) seemed to depend on 5-HT auto-receptor feedback because pre-treatment with 100 nM methiothepin enhanced the [(3)H]5-HT outflow and lowered the CCK(4) threshold concentration from 300 to 30 nM. In addition  pre-treatment with 1 microM bacitracin to inhibit CCK metabolism increased [(3)H]5-HT efflux. This effect was concentration-dependently counteracted by GV150013 suggesting the presence of an endogenous CCK positive modulation. GV150013 30 nM  the 5-HT(1A) partial agonist buspirone 300 nM and the GABA(A) receptor modulator diazepam 10 nM  known to have anxiolytic properties  all significantly reduced the [(3)H] amine outflow from cortical slices by about 20%. This inhibition depended on their interaction with their respective receptors  which seemed to restrain the activity of functionally interconnected glutamatergic interneurones. In fact  APV (50 microM) and NBQX (10 microM) prevented the effect of the anxiolytic compounds. Thus  anxiolytic drugs with different receptor targets can reduce 5-HT outflow by dampening the glutamatergic signal  and in turn  the secretory process of the serotonergic nerve ending."

GABA currents were consistently stimulated by diazepam (EC(50)=63 nM)  zolpidem (EC(50)=85 nM)  loreclezole (EC(50)=10.1 microM) and the neurosteroid 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-hydroxy-20-one (3alpha-OH-DHP). In contrast  GABA-gated currents of the NTS were inhibited by the divalent cation Zn(2+) (IC(50)=33.6 microM) picrotoxin (IC(50)=2.4 microM) and blockade of endogenous protein tyrosine kinase. GABA-activated currents were insensitive to furosemide (10-1000 microM) in all NTS neurons tested. Collectively  the data suggest that in neonatal rats  the predominant alpha subunit isoform present in GABA(A) receptors of the NTS appears to be the alpha1 and/or alpha2 subunit. beta2 and/or beta3 subunits are the major beta isoform  while the predominant gamma subunit is likely gamma2.

Plasma concentrations of diazepam and metabolites differed between the strains with the Harlan-Fischer rats showing higher diazepam concentrations. 5-HT levels in discrete brain regions varied with Harlan-Fischer rats having higher 5-HT concentrations.

The high affinity binding of GABA(A)/BZD receptors with (3H) RO 15-1788 in the brain of naive rats and after administration of FG 7142 did not differ in GAERS and NERs.

After 30 min  [14C]L-arginine (i.v.) was given and  after a further 60 min of anaesthesia  rats were killed and exposed immediately to focused microwave radiation. After removal of the brain and spinal cord  nitric oxide production from radiolabelled arginine (and hence nitric oxide synthase activity during anaesthesia) was measured as [14C]L-citrulline by scintillation counting. cGMP was determined by enzyme immunoassay and tetrahydrobiopterin by fluorescence HPLC  in brain regions and the spinal cord. Nitric oxide synthase activity was similar in all brain regions but was lower in the spinal cord  and was unaffected by anaesthesia. cGMP was similar in all areas of the CNS and was significantly decreased in rats anaesthetized with halothane. Isoflurane produced similar effects. In contrast  ketamine and xenon anaesthesia increased cGMP in the spinal cord  brainstem and hippocampus. Diazepam and pentobarbital had no effect. Tetrahydrobiopterin concentrations were similar in all areas of the CNS and were increased in the cortex and hippocampus after anaesthesia. We have shown profound differential effects of anaesthesia on the nitric oxide pathway in the rat CNS."

The duration of pentobarbital-induced sleep in mice was dose-dependently increased by 2 5-dimethylpyrazine (DMP). The duration of pentobarbital-induced sleep was also increased by an administration route of intracerebroventricular injection. Sleep duration was also increased by the administration of isomers of DMP  2-chloro-3 6-dimethylpyrazine (DMP-Cl) and 2-fluoro-3 6-dimethylpyrazine (DMP-F)  but 3 6-dimethylpyrazine-2-thiol (DMP-SH) did not affect sleep duration. The interval until the appearance of picrotoxicin-induced convulsion was prolonged by DMP and DMP-Cl. Increased sleep duration was obtained by administering DMP in combination with aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) and diazepam compared to a single injection. The interval until convulsion due to picrotoxin was also prolonged by the administration of DMP combined with diazepam and valproic acid (VPA). The interval until the appearance of bicuculline-induced convulsion was also prolonged by pretreatment with DMP. The GABA level in mouse brain was increased by the administration of AOAA  VPA  DMP and DMP-Cl. These results suggest that DMP and other derivatives may strengthen the GABAnergic system in the brain."
"829","11547931","Evidence for an involvement of the ammonia-decreasing action of L-arginine in suppressing picrotoxin-induced convulsions in rats and its additive action with diazepam.","The effects of pre- (30 min before challenge) and post-treatment (5 min after challenge) of L-arginine (840 mg kg(-1)) were tested on picrotoxin-induced increase in ammonia concentrations in brain regions (cerebral cortex  brain stem and cerebellum) and the accompanying convulsive responses in adult male rats. The effect of pre- and post-treatment of L-arginine was tested on the action of diazepam against picrotoxin-induced convulsions. Picrotoxin-induced increase in ammonia concentrations in the brain regions was reverted partially by L-arginine pre-treatment. However  L-arginine pre-treatment failed to inhibit convulsions independently and concurrently with diazepam. On the other hand  L-arginine post-treatment reverted ammonia to control level in all brain regions. A partial but significant inhibition of convulsions was found in these animals. The effect produced concurrently by L-arginine and diazepam post-treatment was much greater than that produced by these agents independently. These results suggest that brain ammonia has a partial but significant participation in the convulsant action of picrotoxin. L-arginine has produced a partial protection of picrotoxin-induced convulsions by reverting brain ammonia to control level. The data further suggest that the duration of action of L-arginine is considerably short and that L-arginine has an additive anticonvulsant action with diazepam."

"831","11534976","Estradiol induces formation of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons: functional correlates.","Dissociated cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons respond to estradiol with a time-dependent  twofold increase in density of their dendritic spines. This effect is mediated by an estrogen receptor  probably of the alpha nuclear receptor type. In searching for the molecular mechanisms leading from the initial activation of the estrogen receptor to the final formation of new dendritic spines  we found that estradiol acts on GABAergic interneurons expressing the estrogen receptor by decreasing their inhibitory tone. In culture  this is assumed to cause a shift in the balance between excitation and inhibition toward enhanced excitation  overactivation of the pyramidal neurons  and subsequent formation of novel dendritic spines. The action of estradiol on spine formation is mediated by phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element binding protein in the pyramidal neurons and is blocked when inhibition is enhanced by diazepam and when excitation is blocked by tetrodotoxin. Progesterone blocks the effect of estradiol on dendritic spines through its conversion to tetrahydroprogesterone  which enhances GABAergic inhibition. Subsequent to formation of novel dendritic spines  there is an increase in the density of glutamatergic receptors in the affected cells  an increase in the cellular calcium response to glutamate  and an increase in network synaptic activity among the cultured neurons."

We studied the age-dependent changes in some of the in vitro and behavioral effects of diazepam in aged (24 months old) rats  comparing them to adults (3 months old). We evaluated the in vitro gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced 36Cl- uptake and the diazepam potentiation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in microsacs from cerebral cortex of both groups of animals. We found no differences in the GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake between adult and aged animals  and diazepam failed to potentiate GABA-induced 36Cl- flux in the aged cortical microsacs. We also examined the effect of 0.03-10 mg of diazepam on locomotor activity in an open-field test and the anxiolytic-like action of diazepam in doses ranging from 0.03 to 1 in a dark-light transition test. We observed no anxiolytic-like action of the drug in the dark-light transition test in the aged rats  while there was a shift to the left in the diminution of locomotor activity evaluated by the open-field test. We conclude that the pharmacodynamic changes observed in cortical GABA(A) receptors in aged rats could partially explain the lack of anxiolytic-like action but not the oversedation evidenced in this group of animals."

First it aimed at investigating the anxiogenic-like behaviors elicited by unavoidable cat exposure and/or cat odor across nine strains of mice (BALB/c  C57BL/6  C3H  CBA  DBA/2  NMRI  NZB  SJL  Swiss) in a modified version of the free-exploration test. The second objective was to investigate possible neurochemical changes following cat exposure in Swiss mice by measuring the turnover of dopamine (DA)  noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) in several brain regions known to be involved in the modulation of emotional processes (hippocampus  hypothalamus and striatum). Finally  the third objective was to examine the effects of anxiolytic drug treatments on the anxiogenic responses elicited by a cat odor (i.e. a feces) in Swiss mice previously exposed to a cat using the free-exploration test. Results from the strain comparison showed that mice could be divided into three distinct groups: two non-reactive strains (NZB and SJL) which were relatively insensitive to predatory exposure and/or odor; five intermediate-reactive strains (Swiss  NMRI  CBA  C3H and BALB/c) which displayed clear anxiogenic-like responses only when exposed to both cat and  subsequently  to feces; and two high reactive strains (C57BL/6 and DBA/2) which showed anxiogenic-like reactions following cat exposure  regardless of the stimulus (clay or feces) present in the free-exploration cage. Neurochemical data revealed that  while brain levels of NA  DA  5-HT in cat exposed Swiss mice were not significantly different from those of control animals  turnover rates of these monoamines were increased in the hippocampus (NA and 5-HT)  hypothalamus and striatum (DA) after cat exposure. Results from pharmacological experiments indicated that repeated administration of the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (5-20 mg/kg  twice a day  for 5 days) completely abolished avoidance of the cat feces in Swiss mice previously exposed to the predator. Neither acute nor repeated administration of the classical anxiolytic diazepam was able to reduce avoidance behavior of the anxiogenic stimulus in the free-exploration test. Taken together  these findings indicate that the exposure of mice to unavoidable predatory stimuli is associated with behavioral and neurochemical changes consistent with increased anxiety."

We assayed levels of mRNAs encoding several of the most predominant GABA(A) receptor subunits as well as cyclophilin mRNA. Analysis of mRNA levels in the cortex in adults showed that only gamma2S mRNA levels varied significantly with prenatal drug exposure  an effect unrelated to DZ action to the GABA(A) receptor. Analysis in fetuses indicated that mRNA levels varied as a function of both fetal sex and fetal drug environment.

"836","11509218","Anxiolytic-like effects of DAIZAC, a selective high-affinity 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, in the mouse elevated plus-maze.","Behavioral effects of desamino-3-iodozacopride (DAIZAC) [(S)-5-chloro-3-iodo-2-methoxy-N-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)benzamide]  a selective high-affinity 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist (K(D) 0.14 nM)  were evaluated in the mouse elevated plus-maze using the anxiolytic benzodiazepine  diazepam  as a positive control. DAIZAC treatment produced a significant dose-related increase in the time spent in the open arm. The increased total time in the open arm resulted from a significant dose-dependent increase in the number of entries into that arm. The minimum dose of DAIZAC associated with a statistically significant increase in entries and time spent in the open arm was 0.05 mg/kg ip  consistent with its high affinity for the 5-HT(3) receptor. DAIZAC did not affect the amount of time spent in the open arm after each entry. Thus  DAIZAC reduced apparent avoidance of the open arm when the animal was in the central compartment  without affecting active avoidance of that arm when the animal was in the exposed condition. The increase in the open-arm entries was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the number of entries into the closed arm with a consequent reduction in the time spent in the closed arm. The time spent in the closed arm after each entry was not altered by DAIZAC administration. As such  the sole apparent effect of DAIZAC was to alter the choice of arm to enter when the animal was in the central compartment. Diazepam also significantly increased total time in the open arm; however  the increase was not attributable to a single behavioral factor. The anxiolytic-like effects of DAIZAC reached maximum by 20-30 min and returned to baseline levels by 90 min. Ex vivo binding studies found that levels of DAIZAC-like activity assayed in brains of mice 25 min after DAIZAC injection were significantly correlated with the behavioral parameters associated with anxiolysis. These results indicate that DAIZAC produces dose-dependent anxiolytic-like behavioral changes in the mouse elevated plus-maze that are correlated with brain DAIZAC-like activity."

In the present study we have examined whether activation of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is involved in the effect of diazepam on basal HPA axis activity. 2. Acute systemic administration of diazepam (10 mg kg(-1) i.p.) was found to increase the basal HPA axis activity  increasing the plasma concentrations of corticotrophin (ACTH) and corticosterone 30 min post injection. Diazepam also elevated cyclic AMP content of the hypothalamus. 3. Pretreatment of the animals with dexamethasone (1 mg kg(-1) s.c.) for 3 days completely abolished the effect of diazepam on HPA axis activity. 4. The antagonists of central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors  flumazenil (10 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and PK 11195 (5 mg kg(-1) i.p.) did not affect the diazepam induced increase of HPA axis activity nor did they have an effect per se. 5.

Caspase-8 is a key initiator of apoptosis via extrinsic  death receptor-mediated pathways; we therefore investigated its role in mediating seizure-induced neuronal death evoked by unilateral kainic acid injection into the amygdala of the rat  terminated after 40 min by diazepam. We demonstrate that cleaved (p18) caspase-8 was detectable immediately following seizure termination coincident with an increase in cleavage of the substrate Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp (IETD)-p-nitroanilide and the appearance of cleaved (p15) Bid. Expression of Fas and FADD  components of death receptor signaling  was increased following seizures. In vivo intracerebroventricular z-IETD-fluoromethyl ketone administration significantly reduced seizure-induced activities of caspases 8  9  and 3 as well as reducing Bid and caspase-9 cleavage  cytochrome c release  DNA fragmentation  and neuronal death. These data suggest that intervention in caspase-8 and/or death receptor signaling may confer protection on the brain from the injurious effects of seizures."

PNZ  its hydroxylated metabolite (HPNZ) and a reference benzodiazepine  diazepam  potently enhanced (up to 200% of control) peak amplitude of currents activated by 10 microM GABA with EC50s of 6.1 +/- 0.8  10.3 +/- 1.4 and 13.5 +/- 1.9 nM respectively. Both PNZ and HPNZ caused a parallel leftwards shift of the concentration/effect relationship for GABA. Another metabolite  6-bromo-(2-chlorophenyl) quinazoline-2-one (QNZ)  augmented responses to 10 microM GABA with a maximal efficacy similar to that of the 1 4benzodiazepines tested  although its EC50 was 2.4 +/- 0.2 microM. A further metabolite  5-bromo-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-aminobenzophenone (ABPH)  had only minimal effects on the responses elicited by 10 microM GABA. Incubation with QNZ and ABPH had biphasic effects on the concentration/effect relationship for GABA. These compounds enhanced peak amplitudes of currents activated by low concentrations of GABA  but inhibited responses to saturating concentrations of the agonist. This effect could  in part  be explained by the acceleration of the desensitisation process by those substances. It is concluded that both PNZ and HPNZ can be referred to as full positive modulators of GABAA receptors and that they are primarily responsible for GABAergic effects of therapeutic doses of PNZ."

Exposure of cells to 10 microM diazepam for 5 days significantly reduced the amounts of alpha(1) and gamma(2) subunit mRNAs  and had no effect on the amount of alpha(4) mRNA. These effects were accompanied by a decrease in the levels of alpha(1) and gamma(2) protein and by a reduction in the efficacy of diazepam with regard to potentiation of GABA-evoked Cl- current. Similar long-term treatment with 10 microM imidazenil significantly reduced the abundance of only the gamma(2)S subunit mRNA and had no effect on GABA(A) receptor function. Withdrawal of diazepam or imidazenil induced a marked increase in the amount of alpha(4) mRNA; withdrawal of imidazenil also reduced the amounts of alpha(1) and gamma(2) mRNAs. In addition  withdrawal of diazepam or imidazenil was associated with a reduced ability of diazepam to potentiate GABA action. These data give new insights into the different molecular events related to GABA(A) receptor gene expression and function produced by chronic treatment and withdrawal of benzodiazepines with full or partial agonist properties."

"842","11440203","Type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor subunits and benzodiazepine binding: significance to clinical syndromes and their treatment.","Gamma (gamma)-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acting via GABAA receptors is the brain's major inhibitory neurotransmitter system and exerts a crucial role in regulating brain excitability. A number of drugs interact with binding sites on GABAA receptors  and these include benzodiazepines  anticonvulsants  anaesthetics and neurosteroids (e.g. the progesterone metabolite pregnalone). GABAA receptors comprise five subunits (19 are known currently)  and are classified into three major groups (alpha  beta and gamma) and several minor ones. The subunit make-up of a receptor  particularly its alpha-subunit content  determines its pharmacological characteristics. Thus  receptors that include an alpha1 subunit have a benzodiazepine (BZ) type I (BZ[I]) pharmacology and bind zolpidem and CL218 872 with high affinity  whilst receptors with alpha2  alpha3 or alpha5 subunits have a BZ type II (BZ[II]) pharmacology and bind these drugs with low affinity. In contrast to receptors that contain alpha4 and alpha6 subunits  which are diazepam-insensitive  both BZ(I) and -(II) bind diazepam and other benzodiazepines. The ligand selectivity of receptor subunits assists in their characterisation. Using immunochemical and ligand-binding techniques  the subunit composition of GABAA receptors has been shown to exhibit a degree of brain regional specificity. GABAA receptors are of great clinical significance in several disorders  including epilepsy  anxiety and alcoholism. In addition to treating epilepsy with drugs that target GABAA and BZ binding sites  epileptic lesions can be localised presurgically using radiolabelled BZ ligands. BZs are used commonly to treat anxiety  and studies suggest that BZ antagonists and inverse agonists (which induce the opposite effect to agonists at receptors) may be useful in alcohol rehabilitation."
"843","11431489","Activation of GABA(A) receptors in subthalamic neurons in vitro: properties of native receptors and inhibition mechanisms.","The subthalamic nucleus (STN) influences the output of the basal ganglia  thereby interfering with motor behavior. The main inputs to the STN are GABAergic. We characterized the GABA(A) receptors expressed in the STN and investigated the response of subthalamic neurons to the activation of GABA(A) receptors. Cell-attached and whole cell recordings were made from rat brain slices using the patch-clamp technique. The newly identified epsilon subunit confers atypical pharmacological properties on recombinant receptors  which are insensitive to barbiturates and benzodiazepines. We tested the hypothesis that native subthalamic GABA(A) receptors contain epsilon proteins. Applications of increasing concentrations of muscimol  a selective GABA(A) agonist  induced Cl(-) and HCO currents with an EC(50) of 5 microM. Currents induced by muscimol were fully blocked by the GABA(A) receptor antagonists  bicuculline and picrotoxin. They were strongly potentiated by the barbiturate  pentobarbital (+190%)  and by the benzodiazepines  diazepam (+197%) and flunitrazepam (+199%). Spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents were also significantly enhanced by flunitrazepam. Furthermore  immunohistological experiments with an epsilon subunit-specific antibody showed that the epsilon protein was not expressed within the STN. Native subthalamic GABA(A) receptors did not  therefore  display pharmacological or structural properties consistent with receptors comprising epsilon. Burst firing is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Half of the subthalamic neurons have the intrinsic capacity of switching from regular-firing to burst-firing mode when hyperpolarized by current injection. This raises the possibility that activation of GABA(A) receptors might trigger the switch. Statistical analysis of spiking activity established that 90% of intact neurons in vitro were in single-spike firing mode  whereas 10% were in burst-firing mode. Muscimol reversibly stopped recurrent electrical activity in all intact neurons. In neurons held in whole cell configuration  membrane potential hyperpolarized by -10 mV whilst input resistance decreased by 50%  indicating powerful membrane shunting. Muscimol never induced burst firing  even in neurons that exhibited the capacity of switching from regular- to burst-firing mode. These molecular and functional data indicate that native subthalamic GABA(A) receptors do not contain the epsilon protein and activation of GABA(A) receptors induces membrane shunting  which is essential for firing inhibition but prevents switching to burst-firing. They suggest that the STN  like many other parts of the brain  has the physiological and structural features of the widely expressed GABA(A) receptors consisting of alphabetagamma subunits."
"844","11420604","GABA concentration sets the conductance of delayed GABAA channels in outside-out patches from rat hippocampal neurons.","GABAA channels were activated by GABA in outside-out patches from rat cultured hippocampal neurons. They were blocked by bicuculline and potentiated by diazepam. In 109 of 190 outside-out patches  no channels were active before exposure to GABA (silent patches). The other 81 patches showed spontaneous channel activity. In patches containing spontaneous channel activity  rapid application of GABA rapidly activated channels. In 93 of the silent patches  channels could be activated by GABA but only after a delay that was sometimes as long as 10 minutes. The maximum channel conductance of the channels activated after a delay increased with GABA concentration from less than 10 pS (0.5 microm GABA) to more than 100 pS (10 mm GABA). Fitting the data with a Hill-type equation gave an EC50 value of 33 microm and a Hill coefficient of 0.6. The channels showed outward rectification and were chloride selective. In the presence of 1 microm diazepam  the GABA EC50 decreased to 0.2 microm but the maximum conductance was unchanged. Diazepam decreased the average latency for channel opening. Bicuculline  a GABA antagonist  caused a concentration-dependent decrease in channel conductance. In channels activated with 100 microm GABA the bicuculline IC50 was 19 microm. The effect of GABA on channel conductance shows that the role of the ligand in GABAA receptor channel function is more complex than previously thought."

Effects of diazepam.","Variations of extracellular dopamine (DA(ext)) levels in prefrontal cortex were assessed by in vivo microdialysis. In rats trained in an operant fixed interval (FI(30s)) schedule of food delivery  acute exposure to contingent foot shocks resulted in a suppression of responding that was reversed by diazepam (4 mg/kg  ip). No changes in cortical DA(ext) levels occurred during this period in both control and treated rats. By contrast  in control rats  cortical DA(ext) levels increased (+25-40%) during the nonpunished component of the operant session  and during noncontingent food delivery (+25%). Control rats placed into an unfamiliar brightly lit openfield exhibited a marked increase in cortical DA(ext) levels (+100%). This effect occurred neither in rats given diazepam at a dose (2 mg/kg) which stimulated motor activity  nor during a second exposure to the openfield. In conclusion  a benzodiazepine-sensitive activation of mesoprefrontal DA neurones is induced by exposure to novel stressful surroundings and by food availability and consumption. The fact that cortical DA(ext) levels remained unchanged in rats that exerted complete control upon negative stimuli indicates that an activation of the mesoprefrontal DA system is not required for punishment-induced behavioural blockade."

Open-field activity was depressed in lorazepam-treated animals on Day 1. On Day 14  open-field parameters were indistinguishable from those of vehicle-treated animals  indicating behavioral tolerance. Benzodiazepine binding  as determined by the specific binding of [125I]diazepam  was also decreased in cortex on Day 14. Hippocampal binding was unchanged following chronic lorazepam exposure. Apparent affinity in cortical membrane preparations was unchanged  indicating that altered ligand uptake was due to decreased receptor number. Muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake into cortical synaptoneurosomes from lorazepam-treated animals was not significantly different on Day 1 or Day 14 compared to vehicle-treated animals. These results confirm that down-regulation of benzodiazepine receptor binding is closely associated with behavioral tolerance to benzodiazepines. These observed changes in binding are not necessarily associated with robust changes in receptor function."
"847","11410716","Altered gabaa receptor subunit and splice variant expression in rats treated with chronic intermittent ethanol.","BACKGROUND: Intermittent chronic administration of ethanol to rats has been shown previously to produce a hyperexcitable  kindling-like state  accompanied by reduced inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and changes in gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors. Further information is needed on the detailed changes in GABAA receptors and their time course and persistence  as is comparison to changes after chronic  continuous ethanol.METHODS: GABAA receptors were analyzed in the rat brain after chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) by using radioligand binding  photoaffinity labeling of polypeptides  and estimates of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of receptor subunits by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization.RESULTS: CIE rats were confirmed to have increased GABAA receptor binding of the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist and ethanol antidote ligand Ro15-4513  due to increased expression of the alpha6 subunit polypeptide in the cerebellum  shown by photoaffinity labeling. Estimates of mRNA levels by use of RT-PCR did not reveal any significant increase in alpha6 or in several other receptor subunits in several brain regions  but a decrease in the ratio of the long and short splice variants (L/S) of the gamma2 subunit was detected in the hippocampus  especially the CA1 region.CONCLUSIONS: Changes in GABAA receptors were found in rats given CIE. Increased alpha6 subunit in the cerebellum was demonstrated by using both the binding to diazepam-insensitive sites for [3H]Ro15-4513 and increased levels of the 57-kDa alpha6 polypeptide after photoaffinity labeling with this ligand. This increase appeared after 30 doses of ethanol and decayed to normal 1 week after ethanol was discontinued. The transient change in cerebellar alpha6 subunit-containing receptors  also reportedly seen after chronic continuous ethanol  is thus unlikely to account for the persistently hyperexcitable  kindled  seizure-susceptible state seen in CIE. However  the significant decrease in gamma2 subunit L/S splice variant ratio in the hippocampus implies changes in GABAA receptor function  possibly involving protein phosphorylation by protein kinase C. Altered receptor trafficking and turnover associated with synaptic plasticity may contribute to the observed reduced inhibition in the hippocampus and other signs of alcohol dependence produced by CIE."

Constitutive Bcl-w expression was detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Bcl-w expression was increased 4-72 h following seizures within the injured hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry determined Bcl-w was predominantly expressed in neurons and seizures increased Bcl-w immunoreactivity within piriform cortex and surviving regions of the injured hippocampus. These data suggest Bcl-w may be involved in the modulation of seizure-induced brain injury."

"850","11402624","The biochemical study of intermaxillary fixation (IMF) stress in oral surgery inpatients.","Although intermaxillary fixation (IMF) is performed to treat the patients with maxillary fracture  this procedure is very stressful to the patients. IMF has been reported to increase noradrenaline (NA) release in the brain and elevate plasma corticosterone contents in the rat. These changes were significantly attenuated by diazepam  an anxiolytic of the benzodiazepine family. These results suggest that IMF could greatly affect the pituitary-adrenal system as a stress. In the present study  in order to examine the influence of IMF on the human body function  we measured levels of 17-hydrocorticosteroids (17-OHCS) and 17-ketosteroid (17-KS)  which are metabolites of the adreno-cortical hormone cortisol  in the urine of inpatients undergoing IMF. The subjects were requested to fill out a questionnaire on irritableness caused by IMF. In these patients  urinary 17-OHCS levels were significantly increased after IMF and well correlated to the results of the questionnaire. The finding suggested that urinary 17-OHCS levels reflect stress related to IMF  and that such stress mainly causes an irritated feeling. Natural killer cell activity (NK activity)  which is considered to be related to stress  was measured in these patients. The relationship between 17-OHCS levels and NK activity was examined in reference to the results of the questionnaire. Questionnaire showed that most patients noted insomnia and an irritated feeling during IMF. To examine the influence of anxiolytic agents on stress related to IMF  an anxiolytic agent  ethyl loflazepate  was administered during IMF  and urinary 17-OHCS levels were measured. There was no correlation between 17-OHCS levels and NK activity in the patients. Furthermore  no correlation was observed between visual analogue scale (VSA) and NK activity. Increases in 17-OHCS levels in the group treated with ethyl loflazepate  an anxiolytic of the benzodiazepine family  were significantly lower than in the untreated group. This suggests that ethyl loflazepate reduced stress responses to IMF. It has been reported that NK activity is reduced inpatients with depression or chronic fatigue syndrome. However  NK activity may not be affected by mechanical stress such as IMF. The finding that an anxiolytic agent  ethyl loflazepate  inhibited stress responses to IMF further suggests that anxiolytic drugs are very useful for treatment of irritated feeling of the patients undergoing IMF."

Equivalent daily doses of 15 mg/kg/day diazepam were delivered either via constant infusion or daily subcutaneous injection for 14 days. The two distinct treatment regimes produced significantly different changes in GABA(A) receptor alpha4-  beta2-  beta3- and gamma1-subunit mRNA steady-state levels. Similar changes in the GABA enhancement of flunitrazepam binding and the BZ3/BZ2 subtype ratio determined ex vivo were produced  however  significant differences were found in [(3)H]-Ro 15-4513 binding between cortical tissue from diazepam injected animals compared with diazepam infused animals. Our data suggest that it is the diurnal fluctuations in receptor occupancy that are responsible for the different effects produced by these two dosing regimes."

This subtype of GABAA receptors is the most common type of GABAA receptor found in the brain  and benzodiazepines are drugs known to enhance the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) by binding to the benzodiazepine binding sites which are part of the GABAA receptor complex. Scatchard analysis of binding data revealed the existence of a single type of binding site for [3H]flunitrazepam. GABA and thiopental enhanced  while the antagonist of central benzodiazepine binding sites--flumazenil  benzodiazepines such as clonazepam  flunitrazepam and diazepam  and the triazolopyridazine CI 218 872--displaced with nanomolar potency the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam. A partial displacement was obtained with the antagonist of the peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites--PK 11195--and with the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. The potency of drugs to enhance or inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding mainly corresponded to that observed for the modulation of the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to the native type 1 benzodiazepine binding sites. This  as well as a high density of expressed binding sites  makes the cell line under study a very reliable and economical model for the testing of effects of different compounds at the GABAA receptor."

Diazepam (30 mg) or midazolam (10 mg) were administered on 5 separate occasions to 4 sheep. For both drugs  rapid cerebral uptake occurred during the infusion  which quickly turned to elution in the postinfusion period. However  this process was more rapid for midazolam than diazepam. The cerebral pharmacokinetics of both was better described by a kinetic model with slight membrane limitation rather than flow limitation. For diazepam  the estimated brain:plasma partition coefficient was 2.67  and the first and second compartments filled with half-lives of 2.2 and 0.5 min  respectively. For midazolam  these values were 0.27  0.26 and 1.34 min  respectively. In a subset of sheep  pulmonary arterial-arterial gradients were too small to measure suggesting limited metabolism and small distribution volumes for both drugs in the lungs. Simultaneous dynamic measurements of cerebral blood flow and algesimetry lagged behind both the arterial and sagittal sinus blood concentrations. The changes in cerebral blood flow were best described by a previously published a dynamic model that incorporated long half-lives for drug dissociation from the benzodiazepine receptor (13.3 and 5.5 min for midazolam and diazepam  respectively). Effect compartment modeling of the cerebral blood flow data showed apparent effect compartment half-lives (t1/2 keo) that were longer than the half-lives of cerebral equilibration."

Chronic epipregnanolone treatment failed to exert any effect on the chick optic lobe total protein content and wet weight at the different doses tested. [3H]Flunitrazepam control binding remained unaltered after neurosteroid exposure  however  the positive allosteric modulation of this ligand by 4 microM allopregnanolone was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by neurosteroid treatment. Embryo exposure to 30 microM epipregnanolone decreased allopregnanolone EC(50) and E(max) values. Analyses of saturation binding isotherms disclosed that such administration had no effect on K(d) and B(max) values for [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]GABA binding. [3H]GABA binding modulation disclosed an increase in allopregnanolone EC(50) value with a decrease in its E(max) value. Diazepam EC(50) and E(max) values were enhanced  while low affinity sodium pentobarbital EC(50) value was reduced by epipregnanolone treatment. The investigation of the GABA(A) receptor function revealed that administration of this neurosteroid reduces the efficacy of GABA to induce 36Cl(-) influx into microsacs prepared from chick optic lobe. These results indicate that endogenous neurosteroid epipregnanolone chronically administered in ovo produces homologous uncoupling between steroid modulatory sites  and those corresponding to benzodiazepine and GABA receptors. Thus epipregnanolone is able to induce heterologous changes in the allosteric linkage between benzodiazepine and barbiturate modulatory sites  and the GABA receptor site. Taken jointly with results on epipregnanolone enhancing effects on [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]GABA binding  in the context of its endogenous synthesis  our present findings support this neurosteroid as the endogenous modulator of GABA(A) receptor sites and function during chick optic lobe development."

These effects may predict an in vivo neuroprotective activity of the drug. Thus  we evaluated whether AIT-082 protected against a long-term excitotoxicity of hippocampal neurons following status epilepticus induced in rats by i.p. injection of kainate (12 mg/kg). The epileptogenic effect of kainate was evaluated by monitoring behavioral signs and by electroencephalographic (EEG) recording (80% of the animals showed status epilepticus with a latency of 96.8 +/- 7.4 min starting from the injection). In surviving rats (40% of the injected animals) the neurotoxic effect was evaluated by measuring glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity  as an index of loss of hippocampal GABAergic neurons  by evaluating the body weight after 7 days and by histological examination of hippocampi. The GAD activity was reduced by 44 +/- 8%  and neuronal loss (about 70%) was found in the CA3c  the CA1 area  and in the dentate gyrus. A single dose of diazepam (20 mg/kg; i.p.  20 min before the kainate injection) almost completely inhibited both seizures and neurotoxicity  ensuring survival of animals. AIT-082 (60 mg/kg/day; i.p.  for 7 days  starting from 20 min before the kainate injection) did not modify the seizures caused by kainate but  like diazepam  it decreased kainate-induced mortality  the reduction of GAD activity  and the loss of hippocampal neurons. These data confirm that AIT-082 is of potential interest for the experimental therapy of neurodegenerative disorders."

Diazepam reduced the pineal melatonin content (by a factor of 2) and the activity of N-acetyltransferase (NAT) (by a factor of 3.5)  as well as plasma melatonin levels (by a factor of 1.5)  but had no effects on pineal hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity. By contrast to the pineal gland  diazepam failed to affect the Harderian gland melatonin content.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the inhibition of melatonin production induced by diazepam in vivo may be due to a direct action of this benzodiazepine on the pineal gland  through its action on NAT  the key enzyme of melatonin synthesis  and that the control of melatonin production in the Harderian glands may be different from that observed in the pineal gland."

Levels of SP  DBI and NPY in the hippocampus  midbrain and hypothalamus of F-344/N and WAG/G rats were then measured without stress (basal levels) or after stress induced by shuttle-box  shock-avoidance testing. Finally  effects of ICV injection of SP or NPY rats were measured in F-344/N and WAG/G rats using the hole-board test.RESULTS: F-344/N rats had elevated level of anxiety compare to WAG/G rats with all five procedures. Levels of SP in the hippocampus  midbrain and hypothalamus of F-344/N rats were significantly lower than in WAG/G rats and levels of SP decreased in WAG/G  but not F-344/N  rats after stress. Levels of DBI in the hippocampus and midbrain of F-344/N rats were also lower than in WAG/G rats  but they increased in F-344/N rats after stress. In contrast  levels of NPY were higher in the midbrain of F-344/N rats than in WAG/G rats  especially after stress. ICV injection of SP or NPY decreased anxiety in the black and white box in both F-344/N and WAG/G rats  but F-344/N rats were more sensitive.CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that decreased levels of SP in certain brain regions may contribute to high levels of anxiety in rats. Decreased levels of DBI and increased levels of NPY in high-anxiety animals may act as compensatory mechanisms."

Biosynthesis of this component is apparently performed with the participation of one cytosolic pool of acyl-CoA and another of free fatty acids. The acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) is present at a concentration at least 7-fold that of the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP)  though lower than that in other armadillo organs such as liver and brain. The ACBP complete amino acid sequence was determined by Edman degradation of peptides generated by cleavage of the protein with cyanogen bromide  endopeptidase Glu-C  and trypsin. ACBP consists of 86 residues and has a calculated molecular mass of 9783 Da  taking into account that an acetyl group is blocking the N-terminus. Identity percentages between armadillo Harderian gland ACBP and other known ACBPs show that the protein belongs to the liver-specific ACBP isoform (L-ACBP). The fact that the ACBP concentration is higher than that of FABP suggests that the Harderian gland is able to store acyl-CoA amounts in ACBP larger than those of fatty acids in H-FABP for 1-alkyl-2 3-diacylglycerol synthesis."

The synthesis of 5alpha-pregnane-3 20-dione and allopregnanolone was stronger in the olfactory bulb than in the frontal cortex. The biosynthesis of allopregnanolone in the frontal cortex was higher by 74  109 and 187% when stimulated by amitriptyline  desipramine and carbamazepine  respectively  and  to a lesser degree  by phenytoin and morphine. Desipramine and morphine decreased the concentration of 5alpha-pregnane-3 20-dione. In the olfactory bulb  only carbamazepine enhanced allopregnanolone production  but none of the tested drugs had any effect on 5alpha-pregnane-3 20-dione synthesis. It is concluded that some psychotropic drugs may increase allopregnanolone synthesis by stimulating the activity of the enzyme  3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  in the frontal cortex  and that this neurosteroid may be partly involved in the mechanism of action of the drugs under study."

Seizures were elicited by microinjection of kainic acid into the amygdala of the rat and terminated after 40 min by diazepam. Caspase-2 was constitutively present in brain  mostly within neurons  and was detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Cleaved caspase-2 (12 kDa) was detected immediately following seizure termination within injured ipsilateral hippocampus  contiguous with increased Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp (VDVADase) activity  a putative measure of activated caspase-2. Expression of receptor interacting protein (RIP)-associated Ich-1-homologous protein with death domain (RAIDD) was increased following seizures  whereas expression of RIP and tumor necrosis factor receptor associated protein with death domain (TRADD)  other components thought to be linked to the caspase-2 activation and signaling mechanism  were unchanged. Intracerebroventricular administration of z-VDVAD-fluoromethyl ketone blocked seizure-induced caspase-2 activity but did not alter caspase-8 activity and failed to affect DNA fragmentation or neuronal death. These data support activation of caspase-2 following seizures but suggest that parallel caspase pathways may circumvent deficits in caspase-2 function to complete the cell death process."
"861","11322706","Uridine receptor: discovery and its involvement in sleep mechanism.","This review deals with the concept of sleep mechanism based on our uridine receptor theory. It is well established that uridine is one of the sleep-promoting substances  we have  therefore  synthesized new types of hypnotic compounds from oxopyrimidine nucleosides. Their mechanism of action in CNS depressant effects is elucidated based on the receptor theory. In this study  structure-activity relationship for CNS depressant properties  sleep-promoting effects  interaction with certain CNS receptors  and receptor binding assay of uridine derivatives as oxopyrimidine nucleoside were investigated. In the studies of structure-activity relationship of N3-substituted uridine  we found for the first time that both N3-benzyluridine and N3-phenacyluridine synthesized exhibited potent hypnotic activity (loss of righting reflex) by intracerebroventicular injection in mice. Moreover  certain derivatives of these compounds possessed synergistic effects with barbiturate and benzodiazepine  and decreased in spontaneous activity  motor incoordination  and antianxiety effects in mice. Especially  N3-phenacyluridine markedly enhanced pentobarbital- and diazepam-induced sleep by 6- and 70-fold  respectively. However  N3-benzyluracil and N3-phenacyluracil that have no ribose moiety did not possess any hypnotic activity  indicating specific effects of nucleoside derivatives. Effects of N3-benzyluridine on natural sleep in rats were thus examined. N3-Benzyluridine also possessed the sleep promoting effect assessed by electrocorticogram at the dose of 10 pmol. For elucidating the mechanism of action of N3-phenacyluridine  the interactions of this compound with benzodiazepine  GABA  5-HT  or adenosine receptors were also investigated. Although the pharmacological activity of N3-phenacyluridine was high  the affinities to benzodiazepine  GABA  5-HT  and adenosine receptors were quite low. [3H]N3-Phenacyluridine concentration-dependently bound to synaptic membrane prepared from the bovine brain. The Scatchard analysis revealed a single component of the binding site. This binding site is proposed here as a novel receptor called &quot;uridine receptor&quot; for hypnotic activity of the uridine derivatives. The rank order of the distribution of these specific binding sites was found to be striatum &gt; thalamus &gt; cerebral cortex &gt; cerebellum &gt; mid brain &gt; medulla oblongata in the rat brain. In the metabolic study of N3-phenacyluridine  we found that this compound was exclusively metabolized to N3-(S)-(+)-alpha-hydroxy-beta-phenethyluridine  but not the (R)- form  in mice. N3-(S)-(+)-alpha-Hydroxy-beta-phenylethyluridine possessed not only strong hypnotic activity but also a high affinity to the uridine receptor of synaptic membranes  while the (R)-isomer was low in both activities. Racemic mixture was shown to be intermediate for pharmacological effects of the compounds. These studies which used (R)- or (S)-isomer indicate that uridine binding site or uridine receptor  exists in the CNS and plays some role in sleep regulation in mammals as one of the triggering steps in inducing hypnotic activity. It is suggested that uridine is released from steps of nucleic acid-nucleic protein biosynthesis (catabolism)  and reaches the binding sites in the areas of the brain which regulate natural sleep. The uridine dissociated from the receptor is then utilized for the synthesis of nucleic acid (anabolism). We propose here that the induction of sleep may be mediated by uridine through uridine receptor in the CNS  although the structure of uridine receptor is not yet elucidated."

In virgin female and male rats  intracerebral infusion of ovine prolactin (oPRL) into the lateral cerebral ventricle (intracerebroventricular) exerted an anxiolytic effect on the elevated plus-maze in a dose-dependent manner (0.1 and 1.0 microg/5 microl; p &lt; 0.01). In contrast  downregulation of the expression of the long form of brain prolactin receptors by chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) (osmotic minipump  0.5 microg. 0.5 microl(-1). hr(-1); 5 d) increased anxiety-related behavior on the plus-maze compared with mixed bases-treated and vehicle-treated rats (p &lt; 0.01)  again demonstrating an anxiolytic effect of PRL acting at brain level. Furthermore  in jugular vein-catheterized female rats  the stress-induced increase of corticotropin secretion was decreased after chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of oPRL (osmotic minipump  1.0 microg. 0.5 microl(-1). hr(-1); p &lt; 0.05) and  in contrast  was further elevated by antisense targeting of the brain prolactin receptors (p &lt; 0.01).

The antisense ODN sequence was selected on the basis of secondary structure molecular modeling of the target mRNA to improve antisense ODN-mRNA hybridization. Receptor autoradiography confirmed the expected improvement in the efficacy of downregulation of prolactin receptor expression [empirically designed antisense  30%; p &gt; 0.05  not significant; adjustment of target position after mRNA modeling  72%; p &lt; 0.05).

The levels of DBI protein and its mRNA significantly increased in the brain derived from mice dependent on alcohol (ethanol)  nicotine and morphine  and abrupt cessation of these drugs facilitated further increase in DBI expression. In the cases of nicotine- and morphine-dependent mice  concomitant administration of antagonists for nicotinic acetylcholine and opioid receptors  respectively  abolished the increase in DBI expression. Therefore  these alterations in DBI expression have a close relationship with formation of drug dependence and/or emergence of withdrawal syndrome and are considered to be a common biochemical process in drug dependence induced by different drugs of abuse."

The degree of additivity for the effect induced by retigabine was greatest for diazepam  phenobarbital  phenytoin and valproate  less for carbamazepine and lamotrigine and least for felbamate. The increase in anticonvulsant activity was usually associated with a comparable increase in motor impairment. However  the therapeutic index of combined treatment (drugs plus retigabine)  was more favourable than the same drug plus vehicle. Since retigabine had no significant influence on the total and free plasma levels of the anticonvulsant drugs  pharmacokinetic interactions  in terms of total or free plasma levels  are not probable. However  the possibility that retigabine modifies the clearance of the anticonvulsant drugs from the brain cannot be excluded. Retigabine had no significant effect on the hypothermic effects of the anticonvulsants tested. In conclusion  retigabine showed an additive effect when administered in combination with classical anticonvulsants  most notably diazepam  phenobarbital  phenytoin and valproate."

Moreover  no PDE4s expressed in mice have been characterized. To address these issues  we isolated two cDNAs representing homologues of PDE4A1 and PDE4B3 from a mouse brain library. After transient transfection in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells  the mouse PDEs hydrolyzed cyclic AMP with a low K(m) and were inhibited by rolipram; both are properties typical of other mammalian PDE4 enzymes. In addition  we found that diazepam inhibited cyclic AMP hydrolysis by the mouse PDE4 subtypes. Interestingly  PDE4B was significantly more sensitive to inhibition by both rolipram and diazepam than the PDE4A subtype. This is the first demonstration that recombinantly expressed PDE4s are inhibited by diazepam  and should facilitate future studies with mouse models of depression and anxiety."
"868","11267639","Diazepam during prior ethanol withdrawals does not alter seizure susceptibility during a subsequent withdrawal.","The number of cycles of alcohol detoxification is suggested to be an important variable in the predisposition to severe withdrawal seizures in alcohol-dependent individuals. Several clinical studies have suggested that exposure to repeated alcohol withdrawals may lead to increased severity of subsequent withdrawal episodes. Consistent with these observations  exposure to multiple cycles of ethanol withdrawal in our previous study significantly increased sensitivity to the convulsive effects of the GABA(A) receptor inverse agonist  Ro15-4513  in comparison to continuous ethanol exposure with no intermittent withdrawals. There was also a selective increase in the occurrence of spontaneous spike and sharp wave (SSW) activity in the EEG recorded from hippocampal area CA(3) in proportion to the number of withdrawal episodes experienced. It is hypothesized that during such repeated episodes of ethanol intoxication and withdrawal  changes in neuronal excitation during prior withdrawals could serve as initially subconvulsive kindling stimuli that might eventually result in the increased severity of the withdrawal syndrome. There is some evidence of the successful suppression of such neuronal excitation during acute ethanol withdrawal by positive modulators of the GABA(A) receptor. In the present study  the benzodiazepine agonist  diazepam  at a dose (4.0 mg/kg) that suppresses acute withdrawal symptoms  when administered during intermittent withdrawals  did not alter seizure sensitivity during a subsequent nonmedicated withdrawal. Diazepam treatment during prior withdrawals also did not have any effect on the multiple withdrawal-associated increase in SSW activity in hippocampal area CA(3) during an untreated withdrawal. This finding suggests that suppression of acute withdrawal symptoms by diazepam does not prevent long-lasting changes in CNS function resulting from repeated exposures to ethanol withdrawal."

Several lines of evidence suggest a crucial involvement of glutamate in the mechanism of action of anxiolytic and/or antidepressant drugs. The involvement of group I mGlu receptors in anxiety and depression has also been proposed. Given the recent discovery of a selective and brain penetrable mGlu5 receptor antagonists  the effect of 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP)  i.e. the most potent compound described  was evaluated in established models of anxiety and depression. 2. Experiments were performed on male Wistar rats or male Albino Swiss or C57BL/6J mice. The anxiolytic-like effects of MPEP was tested in the conflict drinking test and the elevated plus-maze test in rats as well as in the four-plate test in mice. The antidepressant-like effect was estimated using the tail suspension test in mice and the behavioural despair test in rats. 3. MPEP (1 - 30 mg kg(-1)) induced anxiolytic-like effects in the conflict drinking test and the elevated plus-maze test in rats as well as in the four-plate test in mice. MPEP had no effect on locomotor activity or motor coordination. MPEP (1 - 20 mg kg(-1)) did shorten the immobility time in a tail suspension test in mice  however it was inactive in the behavioural despair test in rats. 4. These data suggest that selective mGlu5 receptor antagonists may play a role in the therapy of anxiety and/or depression  further studies are required to identify the sites and the mechanism of action of MPEP."

The mechanisms involved in this action are unknown  but neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may play a role. In this study we investigated the changes in BDNF levels in rats in which SE had been induced by pilocarpine injection (400 mg/kg i.p.) and continued for several hours (unprotected group). In other animals (protected groups)  SE was suppressed after 30 min by intraperitoneal injection of either diazepam (10 mg/kg) + pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) or paraldehyde (0.3 mg/kg). In diazepam + pentobarbital-treated rats the hippocampal damage caused by SE was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) than in unprotected animals. In addition  2 and 24 h after pilocarpine injection  the levels of BDNF mRNA were moderately increased in the unprotected group  but 'superinduced' in protected animals  especially in the neocortex and hippocampus. A time-dependent increase in BDNF immunoreactivity was also found by western blot analysis in rats treated with diazepam + pentobarbital. In contrast  a decrease of BDNF immunoreactivity occurred in the unprotected group. In conclusion  these results show that neuroprotection induced by anti-epileptic drugs in pilocarpine-treated rats is accompanied by strong potentiation of BDNF synthesis in brain regions involved in SE."

Compared with baseline  hippocampal and cortical extracellular levels of serotonin (5-HText) did not change  regardless of operant period (punished or nonpunished) and drug. In contrast  in the striatum  an increase of 5-HText levels (535%) occurred during the punished period  counteracted by DZP. This effect was observed only in rats that were low responders during both nonpunished and punished periods  that is  those that exerted an efficacious control over responding. Uncontrollable shocks or exposure to an unfamiliar open field did not modify striatal 5-HText. Together  these results suggest that an acute activation of 5-HT neurons afferent to the striatum allows the rats to efficiently block responses that are negatively reinforced."

The rank order of displacement efficacy of unlabelled ligands observed suggested that central-type benzodiazepine receptors are present in one class of binding sites (Type I-like) in brain membranes of Mugil cephalus. Moreover  the uptake of 36Cl- into M. cephalus brain membrane vesicles was only marginally stimulated by concentrations of GABA that significantly enhanced the 36Cl- uptake into mammalian brain membrane vesicles.

Results of a food exploration test (hidden cookie method) revealed that the olfactory ability of these mutant mice is identical to that of wild-type mice. However  when preference toward either a socially dominant or subordinate male mouse was assessed in a social preference test  wild-type mice showed a greater preference for socially dominant males than did GRP-R-deficient mice. In contrast  in a social investigation test to an anesthetized male mouse  GRP-R-deficient mice exhibited greater investigatory behavior toward the target male than did wild-type mice. When female C57BL/6J mice were given diazepam (0  1  2 or 4 mg/kg  i.p.)  their investigatory behavior to the anesthetized male target was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely  i.p. administration of bicuculline (1 mg/kg) significantly decreased the social investigatory behavior of female GRP-R-deficient mice  but not of wild-type mice. These results indicate that female GRP-R-deficient mice exhibit altered responsiveness to male conspecifics relative to their wild-type counterparts  and suggest that this outcome may be attributable  at least in part  to altered GABAergic function in these mutant mice."

Tolerance to the anticonvulsant action of diazepam is present in an early phase (6  24  and 36 h) but disappears in a late phase (72-96 h) of withdrawal. In contrast  signs of dependence such as decrease in open-arm entries on an elevated plus-maze and increased susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures were apparent 96 h (but not 12  24  or 48 h) after diazepam withdrawal. During the first 72 h of withdrawal  tolerance is associated with changes in the expression of GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptor subunits (decrease in gamma(2) and alpha(1); increase in alpha(5)) and with an increase of mRNA expression of the most abundant form of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)  GAD(67). In contrast  dl-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor GluR1 subunit mRNA and cognate protein  which are normal during the early phase of diazepam withdrawal  increase by approximately 30% in cortex and hippocampus in association with the appearance of signs of dependence 96 h after diazepam withdrawal. Immunohistochemical studies of GluR1 subunit expression with gold-immunolabeling technique reveal that the increase of GluR1 subunit protein is localized to layer V pyramidal neurons and their apical dendrites in the cortex  and to pyramidal neurons and in their dendritic fields in hippocampus. The results suggest an involvement of GABA-mediated processes in the development and maintenance of tolerance to diazepam  whereas excitatory amino acid-related processes (presumably via AMPA receptors) may be involved in the expression of signs of dependence after withdrawal."

A total of 27 sP  22 sNP and 25 control rats belonging to five other different strains  were studied by direct sequencing and amplification refractory mutation system analysis.

Pharmacological studies have extensively demonstrated that this substitution in the mature peptide changes the benzodiazepine-insensitive receptor to a sensitive one. In order to test the functional significance of this mutation in native cerebellar GABA(A) receptors  selective breeding from Q/R rats was employed to obtain a sufficient number of R/R homozygotes. Xenopus laevis oocytes were then injected with cerebellar synaptosomes extracted from Q/Q  R/Q and R/R sNP rats. Consistently  utilizing the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique  GABA-evoked currents mediated by GABA(A) receptors containing the mutated alpha(6) subunit were potentiated by diazepam with about a two-fold increased potency  as compared to receptors containing the wild-type  benzodiazepine-insensitive alpha(6) subunit. Our data show for the first time that a mutated GABA(A) alpha(6) receptor subunit segregates in a rat line which voluntarily avoids alcohol consumption  and further support a possible involvement of the GABA(A) receptor containing a mutated alpha(6) subunit in the genetic predisposition to alcohol preference."
"876","11233989","Alterations in cerebral diazepam binding inhibitor expression in drug dependence: a possible biochemical alteration common to drug dependence.","Mechanisms for formation of drug dependence and expression of withdrawal syndrome have not fully clarified despite of huge accumulation of experimental and clinical data at present. Several clinical features of withdrawal syndrome are considered to be common among patients with drug dependence induced by different drugs of abuse. One of them is anxiety. Recent investigations have revealed that diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI)  a peptide consisting of 87 amino acids with molecular weight of about 10 kDa  serves as an inverse agonist for benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors with endogenously anxiogenic potential. These lines of data suggest that cerebral DBI expression in brain may participates in formation of drug dependence and/or emergence of withdrawal syndrome. Based on this working hypothesis  we have examined DBI expression in the brain derived from mice depended on alcohol (ethanol)  nicotine  and morphine to investigate functional relationship between cerebral DBI expression and drug dependence. Cerebral DBI expression significantly increases in animals with drug dependence induced by these drugs  and in the cases of nicotine- and morphine-dependent mice concomitant administration of antagonists for nicotinic acetylcholine and opioid receptors  respectively  abolished the increase. Abrupt cessation of administration of drugs facilitated further increase in DBI expression. Therefore  these alterations in DBI expression have close relationship with formation of drug dependence and/or emergence of withdrawal syndrome  and are considered to be a common biochemical process in drug dependence induced by different drugs of abuse. Finding and elucidation of mechanisms for common biochemical alterations among drug dependence may provide a clue to clarify mechanisms for formation of drug dependence and/or emergence of withdrawal syndrome."

However  the K(i)'s for diazepam and for clobazam to displace [(3)H]RY-80 binding in hippocampus were about fourfold higher than for [(3)H]flunitrazepam  and the K(i) for clonazepam was sixfold larger  suggesting that these benzodiazepine receptor agonists bind with relatively lower affinity at hippocampal alpha 5-containing receptors."

Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to a chronic diazepam (DZM) treatment (2 mg/kg/day  i.p.) during 21 days. Twenty-four hours after that treatment and  in another experiment  10 days after the last DZM injection  rats were subjected to an oral ethanol self-administration procedure (ethanol was increased in concentration (v/v) on 4 consecutive days as follows: 2%  4%  6%  8% followed by an additional period of 8 days in which animals were offered a 10% (v/v) ethanol solution. Diazepam treated rats showed a higher ethanol intake and spontaneous signs of ethanol withdrawal when the access to ethanol was discontinued. These results were observed when ethanol was available at day 1 of withdrawal but not when DZM treated rats were initiated in the ethanol choice test 10 days after BDZ withdrawal. Furthermore  DZM treated rats exhibited an increased anxiolytic ethanol induced effect (1 g/kg  i.p.) in the EPM and a significant ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (1 g/kg  i.p.).

Cerebellar granule cells express abundantly six subunits belonging to four subunit classes. These are assembled into a number of distinct receptors  but the regulation of their relative proportions is yet unknown. Here  we studied the composition of cerebellar GABA(A) receptors after targeted disruption of the delta subunit gene. In membranes and extracts of delta-/- cerebellum  [(3)H]muscimol binding was not significantly changed  whereas [(3)H]Ro15-4513 binding was increased by 52% due to an increase in diazepam-insensitive binding. Immunocytochemical and Western blot analysis revealed no change in alpha(6) subunits but an increased expression of gamma(2) subunits in delta-/- cerebellum. Immunoaffinity chromatography of cerebellar extracts indicated there was an increased coassembly of alpha(6) and gamma(2) subunits and that 24% of all receptors in delta-/- cerebellum did not contain a gamma subunit. Because 97% of delta subunits are coassembled with alpha(6) subunits in the cerebellum of wild-type mice  these results indicated that  in delta-/- mice  alpha(6)betagamma(2) and alphabeta receptors replaced delta subunit-containing receptors. The availability of the delta subunit  thus  influences the level of expression or the extent of assembly of the gamma(2) subunit  although these two subunits do not occur in the same receptor."

In experimental models  administration of high doses of BAL produces seizures that culminate in animal death. However  investigations on the modulation of neurotransmitter system(s) involved in BAL-induced seizures are still lacking in the literature. In the present study  the neurotoxicity of BAL  as measured by the manifestation of seizures was examined and the modulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors and ion channels potentially involved in BAL-induced seizures was investigated. The results demonstrated that BAL (18.6 mg/kg) induced seizures and all mice died within one day. GABAergic allosteric modulators (3 or 12 mg/kg diazepam and 50 mg/kg phenobarbital) blocked the appearance of seizure and reduced almost completely the death caused by BAL. Carbamazepine (5 mg/kg) significantly reduced the incidence of BAL-induced seizures  while sodium valproate and MK-801 were not effective in reducing the incidence of seizures. Valproate (300 mg/kg) and MK-801(0.5 mg/kg) prolonged the latencies for onset of seizures; however  all animals died within one day after BAL administration. High doses of ZnCl2 (135 mg/kg) blocked the appearance of seizures episodes  but no animal survived more than one day. The content of total non-protein -SH in brain of mice treated with 18.6 and 124 mg/kg BAL increased from 0.9+/-0.3 nmol/g (control animals) to 1.7+/-0.3 and 3.5+/-0.8 nmol/g  respectively. In vitro  0.1-1 mM concentrations of BAL inhibited [3H]glutamate and [3H]MK-801 binding  but increased the binding of [3H]muscimol to brain synaptic plasma membrane. The results reported here demonstrate that GABAergic allosteric modulators (diazepam and phenobarbital) and carbamazepine  a compound that acts by prolonging the recovery of voltage-activated ion channels from inactivation  are able to abolish BAL-induced seizures  while the NMDA antagonist (MK-801) prolonged the latencies for onset of seizures suggesting that modulators of this subtype of glutamate receptor have a modest role on BAL-induced seizures. The results of the present study suggest that allosteric modulators of GABAergic system and carbamazepine  a voltage-gated Na+-channel antagonist  should be considered for the treatment of animals or patients intoxicated with BAL."

Kindling for 24 days by daily administrations of pentylenetetrazole (20 mg/kg) led to the same decrease in benzodiazepine receptor density (at 1-48 h  but not on day 7) as that observed after a single dose of pentylenetetrazole (50 mg/kg). This suggests a common mechanism for both acute and kindling-induced seizures  dependent on the long-term receptor changes. The increased susceptibility to seizures persisted for 6 months after the termination of kindling  with BDZ receptor density in cerebellar cortex reduced almost by half. In age-matched controls  an acute dose of PTZ (30 mg/kg) induced seizures and decrease in both B(max) and K(d) of [3H]-diazepam binding. In kindled rats  at 6 months post-kindling  the same dose of PTZ (30 mg/kg) restored the benzodiazepine receptor density to the level found 6 months before  at the time of termination of kindling. Also  the severity of seizures was enhanced in the kindled rats. The results are discussed in terms of a balance of inhibitory and excitatory processes  in which the reduced BDZ receptor density at 6 months post-kindling may represent a compensatory reaction to outbalance some alterations in excitatory systems that have been reported to be induced by kindling."

During the following 15 min period  both the protective cage and the resident were removed (nondefeated intruders) or only the protective cage was removed allowing the resident to attack the intruder (defeated rats). This procedure was repeated once daily for 4 d. On the fifth day  a guide cannula was implanted into the prefrontal cortex of intruders. During a single 30 min test session  performed 4 d later  intruders were subjected to only the 30 min protected confrontation to the resident. Anxiety-like behavior (immobility  ultrasonic vocalizations  and defensive postures)  associated with an increase (approximately +100% above baseline) in cortical outflow of CCK-like material (CCKLM)  were observed in defeated intruders. Pretreatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg  i.p.)  but not buspirone (0.5-2 mg/kg  i.p.)  prevented both the anxiety-related behavior and CCKLM overflow. The selective CCK-B receptor antagonist CI-988 (2 mg/kg  i.p.) reduced the anxiety-like behavior without affecting the increase in CCKLM outflow. These data indicate that anticipation of social defeat induces a marked activation of cortical CCKergic neurons associated with anxiety-related behaviors in rats."

In the present study  we have investigated the effect of the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN)  an endogenous ligand of benzodiazepine receptors  in the control of steroid biosynthesis in the frog hypothalamus. Glial cells containing ODN-like immunoreactivity were found to send their thick processes in the close vicinity of neurones expressing the steroidogenic enzyme 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Exposure of frog hypothalamic explants to graded concentrations of ODN (10(-10)-10(-5) M) produced a dose-dependent increase in the conversion of tritiated pregnenolone into various radioactive steroids  including 17-hydroxypregnenolone  progesterone  17-hydroxyprogesterone  dehydroepiandrosterone and dihydrotestosterone. The ODN-induced stimulation of neurosteroid biosynthesis was mimicked by the central-type benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) inverse agonists methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and methyl 6 7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM). The stimulatory effects of ODN  beta-CCM and DMCM on steroid formation was markedly reduced by the CBR antagonist flumazenil. The ODN-evoked stimulation of neurosteroid production was also significantly attenuated by GABA. Collectively  these data indicate that the endozepine ODN  released by glial cell processes in the vicinity of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-containing neurones  stimulates the biosynthesis of neurosteroids through activation of central-type benzodiazepines receptors."

The present experiments attempt to document that drugs may also be transferred by this system. Groups of 10 large male rats were anaesthetised and intubated. Two catheters were inserted into the same carotid artery  one tip pointing towards the head  the other towards the heart. Parallel blood samples were obtained every 30 sec. for 10 min. after nasal administration of radioactively labelled diazepam or cocaine  and the plasma radioactivity measured. Control groups received the drugs intravenously. The uptake of diazepam was rapid  while cocaine uptake was slow. The average ratio between the radioactivity of parallel samples (R: &quot;Head&quot; plasma/&quot;Heart&quot; plasma) in rats treated with nasal diazepam was 1.12+/-0.04  181 (average+/-S.E.M.  n) for the whole 10 min. period and 1.20+/-0.05  96 for the second half of the sampling period. The increase of 12 and 20% is highly significant. The intravenous ratio for diazepam and both R's for the cocaine groups were not significantly different from 1.00. The present experiments show that nasal administration of diazepam induces a relatively higher concentration in the brain arterial blood than in parallel samples obtained from another artery.

After 24 h small platform stress exposure latency to sleep was measured after the administration of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist diazepam (1.0 and 2.5 mg/kg  i.p.) and the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 (1.0 mg/kg  i.p.). As could be expected  diazepam significantly shortened the latency to sleep. Surprisingly the administration of Ro 15-4513 also shortened the latency to sleep. In addition [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding was measured in the cerebellum of control and small platform stressed mice. Small platform stress for 24 h did not alter the maximal number of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites (Bmax) and decreased their affinity (K(D)). Small platform stress for 72 h significantly increased the number of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites and decreased their affinity. These effects were due to changes in diazepam-sensitive binding. In conclusion  it could be supposed that exposure of mice to small platform stress causes changes in the function of the [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites  probably a shift of binding sites toward agonist conformation  that leads to changes in the effects of Ro 15-4513."

Each CV drug combined with or without each AC drug was administered intraperitoneally (IP) 5 min before an IP injection of COCA 75 mg/kg. Of the CV drugs examined  PRA 5 mg/kg and PHEN 5 mg/kg protected against COCA-induced seizures  but only the alpha1-adrenergic blocking agent PRA protected against COCA-induced deaths. Of the AC drugs examined  DZP 5 mg/kg and PHB 50 mg/kg  as well as EtOH 3 g/kg  attenuated the severity of the COCA-induced seizures  but only PHB protected against COCA-induced deaths. The total mortality rate was significantly  often synergistically  decreased compared to the COCA-only group when the appropriate CV drugs were combined with the AC drugs: PRA 5 mg/kg in the EtOH-cotreated groups  PRA 5 mg/kg  PHEN 5 mg/kg or ENA 10 mg/kg in the DZP-cotreated groups  and NIMO 5 mg/kg  PRA 5 mg/kg  PHEN 5 mg/kg  or PRO 10 mg/kg in the PHB-cotreated groups. The decrease in the COCA concentration in the blood and/or brain was not always accompanied by an attenuation of the mortality rate. However  the attenuation of severe seizures by a single PRA  PHEN  DZP  or PHB cotreatment was accompanied by a decrease in the brain COCA concentration."

Diazepam enhanced both NOS activity and the concentration of NO in a dose-dependent manner. A reversal has been observed in animals treated with a convulsant dose of picrotoxin (5 mg/kg) which is known to produce convulsions by blocking GABA A receptor mechanism. These results suggest that a functional interaction occurs between GABA A receptor activity and NO synthesis in the brain."

A mismatch in the integration of sensory inputs could trigger these disturbances. Very few experimental animal procedures have been designed to study the functional link between anxiety and balance control. A task was therefore developed  challenging the visual  vestibular and somesthesic sensory systems in mice. The test  called the 'rotating beam'  gave an accurate assessment of balance control and the posture  using sensitive measures (number of falls and imbalances  position of tail and trunk). Striking differences were observed between the two inbred strains of mice known to have radically different anxiety-related behaviour. The highly anxious strain  BALB/cByJ  performed poorly compared to the non anxious strain  C57BL/6J. Balance control and postural abilities of anxious mice were improved by acute anxiolytic diazepam treatment. Lower behavioural performance level was registered in non anxious mice given anxiogenic beta-CCM treatment. The findings account for a strong relationship between anxiety and balance control in mice. Finally  the highly sensitive procedure proved to be well suited to the study of functional links between anxiety and sensorimotor processes."

Clinical  electrophysiological  and histological approaches were combined. When benzodiazepines were injected at the similar molar dose of 0.7 micromol/kg  the protection against soman toxicity was better with the atropine/ pralidoxime/diazepam combination than with the atropine/pralidoxime/avizafone one. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that this difference of efficacy could be explained by a lower plasmatic load of diazepam obtained after injection of avizafone at 0.7 micromol/kg  compared to the administration of diazepam at the same molar dose. Moreover  after injection of avizafone  plasmatic levels of diazepam were achieved faster and declined more rapidly than after administration of diazepam. Compared to diazepam given at a dose of 0.7 micromol/kg  injection of 1 micromol avizafone/kg gave a similar plasmatic load of benzodiazepine  but with a lower time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) and a higher maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for plasmatic diazepam. We therefore went on to demonstrate that administration of the atropine/pralidoxime/avizafone combination at a dose 1 micromol benzodiazepine/kg to intoxicated monkeys afforded electrophysiological and histological protection similar to that obtained after administration of atropine/pralidoxime/diazepam at a dose of 0.7 micromol diazepam/kg.

Testing a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 5 days (n = 17) was stopped early because of drowsiness around day 5  interfering with regular patient care. A dose of 10 mg twice daily for 3 days was well tolerated  despite reported drowsiness in 12 of 43 patients. First-dose application by rectiole was feasible in 97% of the 104 patients. No blood pressure drop or respiratory arrest or insufficiency were detected  whereas the 2-week case fatality rate was similar to that of controls matched for age  sex  and stroke severity. We conclude that testing the GABAergic activity during the acute phase of stroke by 10 mg diazepam twice daily for 3 days is well tolerated and practically feasible  and it does not subject patients to an increased risk of potential serious adverse effects.

(1) Carbachol triggered beta waves (17.6 +/- 5.7 Hz) in pyramidal regions of 75% of the slices. (2) The waves had phase shifts across the cell body layers and were substantially larger in the apical dendrites than in cell body layers or basal dendrites. (3) Continuous  two-dimensional current source density analyses indicated apical sinks associated with basal sources  lasting approximately 10 msec  followed by apical sources and basal sinks  lasting approximately 20 msec  in a repeating pattern with a period in the range of 15-25 Hz. (4) Carbachol-induced beta waves in the hippocampus were accompanied by 40 Hz (gamma) oscillations in deep layers of the entorhinal cortex. (5) Cholinergically elicited beta and gamma rhythms were eliminated by antagonists of either AMPA or GABA receptors. Benzodiazepines markedly enhanced beta activity and sometimes introduced a distinct gamma frequency peak. (6) Twenty Hertz activity after orthodromic activation of field CA3 was distributed in the same manner as carbachol-induced beta waves and was generated by a current source in the apical dendrites of CA3. This source was eliminated by high concentrations of GABA(A) receptor blockers. It is concluded that cholinergically driven beta rhythms arise independently in hippocampal subfields from oscillatory circuits involving (1) bursts of pyramidal cell discharges  (2) activation of a subset of feedback interneurons that project apically  and (3) production of a GABA(A)-mediated hyperpolarization in the outer portions of the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons."

Emotional behavior in the mutant mice  however  was significantly altered  which manifested in the performance in the open-field  elevated plus maze  and forced swimming tests. The altered performance in the elevated plus maze test was significantly alleviated by treatment with diazepam.

Since cocaine exposure was shown to affect BZ binding density  abuse liability  subjective hypnotic actions and seizure susceptibility  we assessed whether chronic cocaine alters diazepam's anxiolytic and anticonvulsant actions. Changes in GABA(A) receptor subunit protein expression were also assessed as they may relate to BZ activity at the receptor. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with cocaine-HCl (15 mg/kg  i.p.) or saline once daily for 14 days. One day after the last injection  DZP (1 mg/kg i.p.) significantly increased time spent on and entries into open arms of an elevated plus maze in both saline- and cocaine-treated groups  yet the effect was greater in cocaine-treated rats. Eight days after cessation of treatment DZP did not have a significant anxiolytic effect in either group. To assess the effect of cocaine on DZP's anticonvulsant actions  PTZ was infused at a constant rate via the lateral tail vein and clonus onset was recorded in the presence and absence of DZP (5 mg/kg  i.p). DZP significantly elevated seizure threshold in both groups of rats. Chronic cocaine also had no effect on the beta-CCM seizure threshold. Quantitative immunohistochemistry of GABA(A) receptor subunit protein demonstrated significant regulation of alpha2 (-10%) and beta3 (+9%) subunits in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and CA1 regions  respectively. Small changes in GABAR subunit expression in specific brain areas may relate to DZP's enhanced anxiolytic effectiveness whereas it's anticonvulsant actions likely remain intact following cocaine administration."

To study the effect of treatment on a selected population of receptors  assays were performed using [(3)H]RY-80  which is selective for GABA(A) receptors with an alpha 5 subunit. Rats were given a flurazepam treatment known to produce tolerance and down-regulation of benzodiazepine binding  or a diazepam treatment shown to produce tolerance but not receptor down-regulation. Quantitative receptor autoradiography using sagittal brain sections bound with [(3)H]RY-80 showed binding in areas known to express alpha 5 mRNA. Brains from flurazepam-treated rats showed significantly decreased 1 nM [(3)H]RY-80 binding in hippocampal formation (e.g.  32% decrease in CA1) and superior colliculus  but not other areas. Using 5 nM [(3)H]RY-80 showed similar decreases in hippocampus. A corresponding 29% decrease in B(max) but no change in K(d) was found with a filtration binding assay using hippocampal homogenates. Down-regulation of [(3)H]RY-80 binding had returned to control by 2 days after withdrawing flurazepam treatment. The magnitude of down-regulation of [(3)H]RY-80 binding suggested that GABA(A) receptors with an alpha 5 subunit may play a prominent role in the adaptive responses associated with benzodiazepine tolerance. Chronic diazepam treatment also resulted in decreased [(3)H]RY-80 binding. However  the regional selectivity was even more pronounced than in flurazepam-treated rats  and only the hippocampal CA1 region showed decreased binding (27%). This localized down-regulation persisted for several days after the end of diazepam treatment. These data indicate that synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region are particularly involved in the adaptive response to chronic benzodiazepine treatments."

Its effects were compared with those of other anxiolytic agents: the 5-HT1A agonists  buspirone and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin HBr (8-OH-DPAT)  the 5-HT2C antagonist  SB206 553 and the benzodiazepine  diazepam.METHODS: Potential anxiolytic actions were evaluated in the Vogel conflict paradigm (increase in punished responses) and the social interaction (SI) test (increase in active SI) in rats. Extracellular levels of 5-HT were determined by microdialysis.RESULTS: In analogy to diazepam. S15535 increased punished responses in the Vogel test. This action was dose dependently expressed over a broad (16-fold) dose range. Buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT were likewise active  but yielded highly biphasic dose-response curves. SB206 553 was dose dependently active in this model. In the SI test  S15535 similarly mimicked the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam and was active over a broad dose range. Buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT again showed biphasic dose-response curves  as did SB206 553. In both the Vogel and SI tests  the anxiolytic-like effects of S15535 were abolished by the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist  WAY100 635  which was inactive alone. S15535 exerted its anxiolytic-like effects with a more pronounced separation to motor-disruptive doses than the other drugs. Finally  S15535 suppressed dialysate levels of 5-HT in the dorsal hippocampus  an action abolished by WAY100 635. Buspirone  8-OH-DPAT and diazepam  but not SB206 553  also reduced 5-HT levels.CONCLUSION: Likely reflecting its distinctive ability to selectively and preferentially activate pre- versus postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors  S15535 suppresses hippocampal 5-HT release and displays marked anxiolytic-like effects over a broad dose range in the relative absence of motor perturbation."

Rats were either handled  placed within the testing context without receiving the footshock  received a footshock immediately upon placement within the context  or received a footshock after a 3-min delay (delayed-shock). Only the delayed-shock group displayed a fear response (freezing) in the post-shock period and in a retention test 24 h after fear conditioning. Expression of NGFI-B mRNA was increased in the dorsolateral part of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LaDL) and the neocortex 30 min following conditioning in the delayed-shock group compared to the other three groups. In addition  following a retention test conducted 24 h after fear conditioning  NGFI-B mRNA expression was increased in the neocortex of the delayed-shock group compared to the handled group. In a subsequent experiment  the effects of pretreatment with the anxiolytic drug  diazepam  on fear conditioning and the concomitant increases in NGFI-B mRNA were investigated. Rats administered a 2.5 mg/kg  i.p. dose of diazepam before fear conditioning did not acquire contextual fear as demonstrated by a lack of freezing in a retention test. Although diazepam blocked fear conditioning while the 40% propylene glycol  10% ethanol vehicle solution did not  both diazepam and the vehicle reduced the conditioning-induced increase in NGFI-B expression in the LaDL. In contrast  the fear-conditioning-induced NGFI-B increase in the neocortex was blocked by diazepam  but not by the vehicle. The data suggest that the transcriptional factor NGFI-B in the LaDL and neocortex may play a functional role in learning and memory of contextual fear  but blocking the increase in NGFI-B expression in the LaDL is not essential for diazepam to interfere with fear conditioning."

Nicotine-induced (0.1 microM) increases in DBI mRNA expression were abolished by hexamethonium  a nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor antagonist. Agents that stabilize the neuronal membrane  including tetrodotoxin (TTX)  procainamide (a Na(+) channel inhibitor)  and local anesthetics (dibucaine and lidocaine)  dose-dependently inhibited the increased expression of DBI mRNA by nicotine. The nicotine-induced increase in DBI mRNA expression was inhibited by L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel (VDCC) inhibitors such as verapamil  calmodulin antagonist (W-7)  and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAM II kinase) inhibitor (KN-62)  whereas P/Q- and N-type VDCC inhibitors showed no effects. In addition  nicotine exposure for 24 h induced [3H]nicotine binding to the particulate fractions of the neurons with an increased B(max) value and no changes in K(d). Under these conditions  the 30 mM KCl- and nicotine-induced 45Ca(2+) influx into the nicotine-treated neurons was significantly higher than those into non-treated neurons. These results suggest that the nicotine-stimulated increase in DBI mRNA expression is mediated by CAM II kinase activation resulting from the increase in intracellular Ca(2+) through L-type VDCCs subsequent to the neuronal membrane depolarization associated with nACh receptor activation."
"903","11033344","Noradrenaline systems in the hypothalamus, amygdala and locus coeruleus are involved in the provocation of anxiety: basic studies.","A variety of stressful events  including emotional stress  cause a marked increase in noradrenaline release in several brain regions  and especially in the hypothalamus  amygdala and locus coeruleus  in the rat brain. These findings suggest that an increased noradrenaline release could be closely related to the provocation of negative emotions such as anxiety and/or fear. In order to confirm this hypothesis  we carried out several studies. Diazepam  a typical benzodiazepine anxiolytic  significantly attenuated not only the immobilization stress-induced increase in noradrenaline release in the three rat brain regions but also the emotional changes of these animals  and these effects were antagonized by flumazenil  a benzodiazepine antagonist. Naloxone and opioid agents  such as morphine  beta-endorphin and [Met(5)]-enkephalin  significantly enhanced and attenuated the stress-induced increase in noradrenaline release in these regions and the stress-induced emotional change  respectively. Two stressful events which predominantly involve emotional factors  i.e.  psychological stress and conditioned fear  caused significant increases in noradrenaline release selectively in these three brain regions and these increases were also significantly attenuated by pretreatment with diazepam in a flumazenil reversible manner. Yohimbine  an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist which caused a marked increase in noradrenaline release in the several brain regions  had an anxiolytic action in the two behavioral tests involving anxiety  i.e.  the conditioned defensive burying test and the modified forced swim test. beta-Carbolines  which possess anxiogenic properties  significantly increased noradrenaline release in the hypothalamus  amygdala and locus coeruleus. Taken together  these findings suggest that the increased release of noradrenaline in the hypothalamus  amygdala and locus coeruleus is  in part  involved in the provocation of anxiety and/or fear in animals exposed to stress  and that the attenuation of this increase by benzodiazepine anxiolytics acting via the benzodiazepine receptor/GABAA receptor/chloride ionophore supramolecular complex may be the basic mechanism of action of these anxiolytic drugs."

Rats avoided the dark chamber  where they were previously subjected to electric footshock  and they exhibited increased numbers of defecations and gastric ulcers. Moreover  they showed increased NPY-LI in the amygdala  nucleus accumbens and hypothalamus  and decreased NPY-LI in the frontal cortex. Diazepam (1 or 3 mg/kg) and buspirone (1.5 or 5 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited passive avoidance and decreased the numbers of defecations  and they also decreased the number of gastric ulcers. Diazepam reversed while buspirone only attenuated the fear-induced changes in NPY-LI in all regions studied. In the amygdala  the effect of diazepam was dose-dependent. The effect of diazepam on both behaviour and NPY-LI was antagonized by flumazenil (15 mg/kg). Apart from supporting the role of the NPY system in fear and anxiety  the results of this study suggest that NPY is involved in the anxiolytic effects of diazepam and buspirone and that the effect of diazepam is mediated by benzodiazepine receptors."

The anxiolytic action of diazepam was absent in mice with the alpha2(H101R) point mutation but present in mice with the alpha3(H126R) point mutation.

However  seizures are irreversibly abolished by blockers of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors given locally or systemically. SSSE is enhanced by substance P and its agonists and blocked by its antagonists. SSSE induces novel expression of substance P-like immunoreactivity in hippocampal principal cells.

Moreover  the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor induced by electroshocks (ECS) might protect hippocampal cells from death in patients suffering from depression. As temporal lobe epilepsy is linked to neuronal damage in the hippocampus  we tested the effect of repeated ECS on subsequent status epilepticus (SE) induced by lithium-pilocarpine and leading to cell death and temporal epilepsy in the rat. Eleven maximal ECS were applied via ear-clips to adult rats. The last one was applied 2 days before the induction of SE by lithium-pilocarpine. The rats were electroencephalographically recorded to study the SE characteristics. The rats treated with ECS before pilocarpine (ECS-pilo) developed partial limbic (score 2) and propagated seizures (score 5) with a longer latency than the rats that underwent SE alone (sham-pilo). Despite this delay in the initiation and propagation of the seizures  the same number of ECS- and sham-pilo rats developed SE with a similar characteristic pattern. The expression of c-Fos protein was down-regulated by repeated ECS in the amygdala and the cortex. In ECS-pilo rats  c-Fos expression was decreased in the piriform and entorhinal cortex and increased in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Neuronal damage was identical in the forebrain areas of both groups  while it was worsened by ECS treatment in the substantia nigra pars reticulata  entorhinal and perirhinal cortices compared to sham-pilo rats. Finally  while 11 out of the 12 sham-pilo rats developed spontaneous recurrent seizures after a silent period of 40+/-27 days  only two out of the 10 ECS-pilo rats became epileptic  but after a prolonged latency of 106 and 151 days. One ECS-pilo rat developed electrographic infraclinical seizures and seven did not exhibit any seizures. Thus  the extensive neuronal damage occurring in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices of the ECS-pilo rats seems to prevent the establishment of the hyperexcitable epileptic circuit."

Immunoreactive ODN-like material was found in the telencephalon at the level of bundles of different olfactory nerve fibres. Moreover  at the level of the pallium  immunoreactive multipolar neurons were observed in the pars parvocellularis of the stratum griseum superficialis. Similar immunopositive nerve cell bodies were found in the nucleus medialis of the central prosencephalic complex. In the mesencephalon  few immunoreactive neurons lining and contacting the mesencephalic ventricle were detected; such nerve cells could be involved in the regulation of cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis. Dorsally in the mesencephalon  numerous ODN-containing cell bodies were present in the area praetectalis. The rhomboencephalon was immunostained only in the octavolateral area and in the nucleus motorius magnocellularis of the trigeminal nerve. Furthermore  ODN immunoreactivity was also present in the nerve cells of ganglia of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve complex. The immunocytochemical patterns described here in the brain of M. glutinosa suggest an involvement of ODN-like peptides as neuromodulators in sensory pathways  such as olfactory and visual. Finally  ODN-like substances were localized in discrete populations of adenohypophysial cells and in tanycytes lining the neurohypophyseal walls  suggesting for endozepines a paracrine and/or endocrine control of pituitary hormones release and a neurohormone role respectively.

Veratridine  a pharmacological activator of the voltage-dependent sodium channel  that inhibits standard [3H]phenytoin binding  failed to affect the high affinity diazepam-potentiated [3H]phenytoin binding in brain membranes  suggesting that the potentiated binding interaction resides at a site distinct from the voltage-dependent sodium channel. This possibility was confirmed by anion exchange chromatography of digitonin-solubilized rat brain membranes  as diazepam-potentiated high affinity [3H]phenytoin binding eluted in column fractions that were distinct from [3H]saxitoxin-defined voltage-dependent sodium channels. To examine whether diazepam-potentiated [3H]phenytoin binding might be associated with other 'classic' benzodiazepine receptor sites  we tested whether specific ligands for benzodiazepine receptors would either produce or block potentiated [3H]phenytoin binding. Neither agonists  nor antagonists  of the high affinity central-type benzodiazepine receptor affected potentiated [3H]phenytoin binding  suggesting that the high affinity potentiated binding site is not likely associated with central benzodiazepine receptors. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor agonists  however  did potentiate [3H]phenytoin binding  and a specific receptor antagonist (PK11195) attenuated the potentiation seen with diazepam. Overall  these data illustrate that [3H]phenytoin interacts with a novel site in brain membranes that is distinct from the voltage-dependent sodium channel and is allosterically revealed by peripheral-type  but not central-type  benzodiazepine receptor agonists."
"911","10973513","The pharmacodynamics of PK 11195 in diazepam-dependent male and female rats.","These studies were undertaken to 1) determine whether repeated dosing with the peripheral benzodiazepine antagonist PK 11195 alters its ability to precipitate withdrawal abstinence in diazepam-dependent rats; 2) whether the administration of PK 11195 and the central benzodiazepine antagonist  flumazenil  3 days apart to the same rat produces an ordering effect in the intensity of withdrawal abstinence; 3) whether there are gender differences in these effects. Age-matched male and female Sprague Dawley rats had capsules implanted weekly that contained approximately equal (mg/kg) doses of diazepam (120 and 90 mg  respectively) or empty capsules (controls). After 5 implants  the maximum precipitated withdrawal score (PAS(MAX)) induced by PK 11195 and/or flumazenil (10 mg/kg/IV  respectively) was measured. Repeated administration of PK 11195 (1x/day for 5 days) induced tolerance with regard to the intensity of the PAS(MAX) and with gender-related differences. When PK 11195 was administered weekly (5 weeks)  rather than daily  tolerance did not develop in either sex. The PK 11195- and flumazenil-induced PAS(MAX) was not changed by the order in which they were administered. There were gender differences in that females had a higher PAS(MAX) after flumazenil than after PK 11195 and vocalized more after all treatments than males."

Simultaneously  the effects of the classical 1 4-benzodiazepine on these enzymes were also studied for comparative purpose. The compounds 2-trichloromethyl-4-phenyl-3H-1 5-benzodiazepin and 2-trichloromethyl-4(p-methyl-phenyl)-3H- 1 5-benzodiazepin significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity (p &lt; 0.01) when tested in the range of 0.18-0.35 mM. The inhibition caused by these two new benzodiazepines was noncompetitive in nature. Similarly  at concentrations ranging from 0.063 to 0.25 mM  the 1 5 benzodiazepines inhibited ATP and ADP hydrolysis by synaptosomes from cerebral cortex (p &lt; 0.01). However  the inhibition of nucleotide hydrolysis was uncompetitive in nature. Our results suggest that  although diazepam and the new benzodiazepines have chemical differences  they both presented an inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase and ATPDase activities."

The conductance increased from 12 +/- 4 to 62 +/- 9 pS as the pentobarbital concentration was raised from 10 to 500 microM and the data could be fitted by a Hill-type equation. At 100 microM pentobarbital plus 0.5 microM GABA  the conductance seemed to reach a plateau. The pentobarbital EC(50)(0.5 microM GABA) value was 22 +/- 4 microM and n was 1.9 +/- 0.5. In 1 mM pentobarbital plus 0.5 microM GABA  the single-channel conductance decreased to 34 +/- 8 pS. This apparent inhibition of channel conductance was relieved by 1 microM diazepam. The channel conductance was 64 +/- 6 pS in the presence of all three drugs. The channels were open more in the presence of both GABA and pentobarbital than in the presence of either drug alone. Pentobarbital alone (100 microM) activated channels with conductance (30 +/- 2 pS) and kinetic properties distinct from those activated by either GABA alone or GABA plus pentobarbital. Whether pentobarbital induces new conformations or promotes conformations observed in the presence of GABA alone cannot be determined from our study  but the results clearly show that it is the combination of drugs present that determines the single-channel conductance and the kinetic properties of the receptors."

Because diazepam reduces dopamine activity in the nucleus accumbens  three experiments were conducted in order to investigate whether diazepam selectively blocks the expression of place conditioning dependent on mesolimbic dopamine. The first experiment found that systemic diazepam blocked the expression of conditioned place aversion induced by the kappa-receptor agonist U50-488. The second and third experiments demonstrated that intra-cranial injections of diazepam in the nucleus accumbens blocked the expression of amphetamine CPP but not of morphine CPP. It is concluded that diazepam interferes with mesolimbic dopamine-dependent motivational effects of drugs."
"915","10936207","Diazepam promotes ATP recovery and prevents cytochrome c release in hippocampal slices after in vitro ischemia.","Benzodiazepines protect hippocampal neurons when administered within the first few hours after transient cerebral ischemia. Here  we examined the ability of diazepam to prevent early signals of cell injury (before cell death) after in vitro ischemia. Ischemia in vitro or in vivo causes a rapid depletion of ATP and the generation of cell death signals  such as the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Hippocampal slices from adult rats were subjected to 7 min of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and assessed histologically 3 h after reoxygenation. At this time  area CA1 neurons appeared viable  although slight abnormalities in structure were evident. Immediately following OGD  ATP levels in hippocampus were decreased by 70%  and they recovered partially over the next 3 h of reoxygenation. When diazepam was included in the reoxygenation buffer  ATP levels recovered completely by 3 h after OGD. The effects of diazepam were blocked by picrotoxin  indicating that the protection was mediated by an influx of Cl(-) through the GABA(A) receptor. It is interesting that the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil did not prevent the action of diazepam  as has been shown in other studies using the hippocampus. Two hours after OGD  the partial recovery of ATP levels occurred simultaneously with an increase of cytochrome c (approximately 400%) in the cytosol. When diazepam was included in the reoxygenation buffer  it completely prevented the increase in cytosolic cytochrome c. Thus  complete recovery of ATP and prevention of cytochrome c release from mitochondria can be achieved when diazepam is given after the loss of ATP induced by OGD."

The objective of our study was to investigate the possible neuroprotective effects of sodium salicylate in vivo in rats with kainic acid-induced seizures  a model for temporal lobe epilepsy in human patients. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received intraperitoneal injections of kainic acid either alone  or with sodium salicylate given before and for 40h after kainic acid injections. The control group received either phosphate-buffered saline or sodium salicylate without co-administration of kainic acid. Animals developed status epilepticus  which was aborted 1.5-2h later with diazepam. On day 3 following kainic acid-induced seizures  animals received bromodeoxyuridine to measure cellular proliferation  and were killed under anesthesia 24h later. Brains were removed  sectioned  and analysed for gross histological changes  evidence of hemorrhage  DNA fragmentation  cellular proliferation  and microglial immunohistochemistry. We report that sodium salicylate did not protect neurons from seizure-induced cell death  and to the contrary  it caused focal hemorrhage and cell death in the hippocampal formation and the entorhinal/piriform cortex of rats with kainic acid-induced seizures. Hemorrhage was never observed in animals that received vehicle  kainic acid or sodium salicylate only  which indicated that sodium salicylate exerted its effect only in animals with seizures  and was confined to select regions of the brain that undergo seizure activity. Large numbers of cells displaying DNA fragmentation were detected in the hippocampal formation  entorhinal/piriform cortex and the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus of rats that received kainic acid or kainic acid in combination with sodium salicylate. Bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemistry revealed large numbers of proliferating cells in and around the areas with most severe neural injury induced by kainic acid or kainic acid co-administered with sodium salicylate. These same brain regions displayed intense staining with a microglia-specific marker  an indication of microglial activation in response to brain damage. In all cases  the degree of cell death  cell proliferation and microglia staining was more severe in animals that received the combination of kainic acid and sodium salicylate when compared to animals that received kainic acid alone. We hypothesize that our findings are attributable to sodium salicylate-induced blockade of cellular mechanisms that protect cells from calcium-mediated injury. These initial observations may have important clinical implications for patients with epilepsy who take aspirin while affected by these conditions  and should promote further investigation of this relationship."
"917","10899955","Benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors limit the activity of the NMDA/NO/cyclic GMP pathway: a microdialysis study in the cerebellum of freely moving rats.","In the cerebellum  infusion of NMDA (200 microM) for 20 min evoked a marked (200%) increase of extracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels. The selective GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (0.01-100 microM) was able to counteract the NMDA effect with an EC(50) of 0.65 microM; the inhibitory effect of muscimol (10 microM) was prevented by bicuculline (50 microM). Diazepam (10 microM) significantly potentiated the muscimol (1 microM) inhibition; furthermore  when coinfused with 0.1 microM muscimol (a concentration not affecting  on its own  the cGMP response to NMDA)  diazepam (10 microM) reduced the NMDA effect. Similar results were obtained with zolpidem (0.1-1 microM). Finally  local infusion of the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil (10 microM)  together with muscimol and diazepam  almost completely restored the effect of NMDA on extracellular cGMP levels. It is concluded that GABA(A) receptors potently control the NMDA/nitric oxide/cGMP pathway in the cerebellum in vivo. In terms of the alpha subunit composition  we can deduce that the cerebellar GABA(A) receptor does not contain alpha(6) or beta(4) subunits because it is diazepam-sensitive. Moreover  the observation that zolpidem is active at a rather low concentration  in combination with localization studies present in the literature  tend to exclude the presence of alpha(5) subunits in the receptor composition and suggest the involvement of an alpha(1) subunit."
"918","10899949","Social isolation-induced decreases in both the abundance of neuroactive steroids and GABA(A) receptor function in rat brain.","The effects of social isolation on behavior  neuroactive steroid concentrations  and GABA(A) receptor function were investigated in rats. Animals isolated for 30 days immediately after weaning exhibited an anxiety-like behavioral profile in the elevated plus-maze and Vogel conflict tests. This behavior was associated with marked decreases in the cerebrocortical  hippocampal  and plasma concentrations of pregnenolone  progesterone  allopregnanolone  and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone compared with those apparent for group-housed rats; in contrast  the plasma concentration of corticosterone was increased in the isolated animals. Acute footshock stress induced greater percentage increases in the cortical concentrations of neuroactive steroids in isolated rats than in group-housed rats. Social isolation also reduced brain GABA(A) receptor function  as evaluated by measuring both GABA-evoked Cl(-) currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing the rat receptors and tert-[(35)S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([(35)S]TBPS) binding to rat brain membranes. Whereas the amplitude of GABA-induced Cl(-) currents did not differ significantly between group-housed and isolated animals  the potentiation of these currents by diazepam was reduced at cortical or hippocampal GABA(A) receptors from isolated rats compared with that apparent at receptors from group-housed animals. Moreover  the inhibitory effect of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate  a negative allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors  on these currents was greater at cortical GABA(A) receptors from socially isolated animals than at those from group-housed rats. Finally  social isolation increased the extent of [(35)S]TBPS binding to both cortical and hippocampal membranes. The results further suggest a psychological role for neurosteroids and GABA(A) receptors in the modulation of emotional behavior and mood."

In the present study  we have investigated the possible effect of one of the DBI-derived peptides  the triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN)  on [(3)H]thymidine incorporation in cultured rat astrocytes. Reversed-phase HPLC analysis of incubation media indicated that TTN is the major form of DBI-derived peptides released by cultured astrocytes. At very low concentrations (10(-14)-10(-11) M)  TTN induced a dose-dependent increase in [(3)H]thymidine incorporation  whereas at higher concentrations (10(-10)-10(-5) M) the effect of TTN gradually declined. In the same range of concentrations  the specific peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) agonist Ro 5-4864 mimicked the bell-shaped stimulatory effect of TTN on [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. The PBR antagonist PK11195 (10(-6) M) suppressed the stimulatory action of both TTN and Ro 5-4864 on [(3)H]thymidine incorporation  whereas the central-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10(-6) M) had no effect. The present study demonstrates that the endozepine TTN stimulates DNA synthesis in rat glial cells through activation of PBRs. These data strongly suggest that TTN exerts an autocrine/paracrine stimulatory effect on glial cell proliferation."
"920","10899383","Effects of buspirone, diazepam, and zolpidem on open field behavior, and brain [3H]muscimol binding after buspirone pretreatment.","The effects of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist buspirone  a nonselective (diazepam)  and a selective (zolpidem) GABA(A) receptor agonist were compared in the open field test of neophobia. Unhabituated rats were pretreated with the drugs once  prior to a first exposure to the open field  and their behavior was recorded both during this test and during a second trial 24 h later. It has been hypothesized that the decrease in exploratory activity observed during the second test session may be considered an adaptive reaction to the first day aversive experience (neophobia). If so  a selective modulation of 5-HT and GABA systems activity during the test could bring about significant changes in animal behavior on the retest. Buspirone at the lowest dose of 0.3 mg/kg revealed anxiolytic-like properties on the first day  whereas the action of diazepam and zolpidem was modulated by the dose-related sedative effect. At the dose of 2.4 mg/kg buspirone elicited delayed in time anxiolytic-like action  i.e.  produced the antithigmotactic effect during the retrial 24 h later. Diazepam and zolpidem failed to exhibit similar profile of action. Autoradiography of [3H]muscimol binding after pretreatment of rats with buspirone showed a significant increase in the selective radioligand binding within the frontal cortex and a similar  near-significant tendency in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The behavioral data validate buspirone as important drug for the treatment of anxiety disorders  devoid of disruptive influence on motor and cognitive processes. The open field test  as modified by us  appeared sensitive in distinguishing the behavioral profiles of action of different anxiolytic compounds  including 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist. The present results support the assumption that reduced turnover of 5-HT due to stimulation of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors  may bring about changes in GABA(A) receptor system activity  in some brain structures  leading to the anxiolytic effect."
"921","10882844","Diazepam attenuation of somatostatin binding and effect of somatostatin on accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the rat frontoparietal cortex.","Numerous reports in both humans and animals have confirmed that benzodiazepines produce amnesia; however  mechanisms mediating this effect are not clear. In view of the important role of brain somatostatin (SRIF) in the cognitive function of rats  this study sought to determine if the benzodiazepine  diazepam  alters somatostatinergic system in the rat frontoparietal cortex. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of diazepam (5 mg/kg/day) to male Wistar rats (200-250 g) for 3 or 7 days decreased the number of SRIF receptors (26 and 37%  respectively) in synaptosomes from the frontoparietal cortex  without influencing their apparent affinity. This decrease in the tracer binding was not attributable to a direct effect of diazepam on SRIF receptors  because no decrease of SRIF binding was induced by a large concentration of diazepam (10(-4) M) when the drug was added to a preparation of synaptosomes from frontoparietal cortex of untreated rats. To determine if the effect of diazepam on SRIF binding is related to the binding of diazepam to its recognition site on the GABA(A) receptor  a benzodiazepine antagonist  2-phenylpyrazolo[3 4-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one (CGS 8216) was administered before the diazepam injection. Pretreatment with CGS 8216 (20 mg/kg/day  i.p.) blocked completely the diazepam-induced decrease in the number of SRIF receptors. CGS 8216 alone had no observable effect. The decrease in the number of 125I-Tyr11-SRIF receptor induced by diazepam was accompanied by a decrease in the effect of SRIF  after 15 seconds of stimulation  on inositol 1 4  5-trisphosphate (IP3) mass accumulation in the rat frontoparietal cortex at 3 (64%) or 7 days (59%) after its administration. Diazepam alone had no observable effect on mass accumulation of IP3. After 14 days of daily diazepam injections  the levels of binding of 125I-Tyr11-SRIF in the frontoparietal cortex returned to control values  coinciding with the tolerance that develops to this benzodiazepine agonists when administered chronically. The decrease in IP3 levels was still observed after 14 days (57%) diazepam administration. Diazepam and CGS 8216 did not affect SRIF-like immunoreactivity levels in the frontoparietal cortex at the three time intervals studied (3  7 or 14 days). The alteration of frontoparietal cortex SRIF receptor-effector system after 3 or 7 days of diazepam treatment suggests that somatostatinergic neurotransmission plays a role in the mechanism of diazepam action on memory."

LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) was devoid of any significant action upon each seizure parameter in kindled rats (seizure severity  seizure duration  after-discharge duration). LY 300164 (5 mg/kg) exerted a significant anticonvulsive effect as regards seizure and after-discharge durations. Combined treatment with LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.3125-1.25 mg/kg) resulted in the clear-cut anticonvulsive activity. It is noteworthy that the antiseizure potency of the combined treatment (diazepam 1.25 mg/kg plus LY 300164 2 mg/kg) was comparable to that of diazepam (10-20 mg/kg) alone. The combination of diazepam (1.25 mg/kg) with LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) did not induce any significant motor impairment in the rotorod test or memory deficit in the passive-avoidance task. In contrast  diazepam alone (10-20 mg/kg) had pronounced adverse effects in kindled animals. LY 300164 (up to 2 mg/kg) did not influence the threshold for electro- and pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions but potentiated the anticonvulsive action of diazepam in the maximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazol test in mice  the ED50s of the benzodiazepine being reduced from 13 to 8.7 and from 0.29 to 0.049 mg/kg  respectively. As shown in the passive-avoidance task  combination of LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) with diazepam (8.7 mg/ kg) produced significant motor and long-term memory impairment. Diazepam alone (at the dose equal to its ED50 against maximal electroshock) also caused motor and memory deficits in mice. Interaction at the pharmacokinetic level  at least in plasma  can be excluded  because LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) did not affect the free plasma diazepam concentration. In conclusion  LY 300164 potentiates the protective action of diazepam in some animal models of seizures. This profitable interaction may create a new approach for the treatment of drug resistant epilepsy or status epilepticus."
"923","10880692","Mice lacking the long splice variant of the gamma 2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor are more sensitive to benzodiazepines.","The gamma 2 subunit is required for benzodiazepine modulation of the GABA(A) receptor. Alternate splicing of precursor GABA(A) gamma 2 mRNA results in two splice variants  a short (gamma 2S) and a long (gamma 2L) variant. We investigated the roles of these splice variants in benzodiazepine pharmacology using mice lacking genes for the gamma 2L splice variant. Sleep time responses to midazolam and zolpidem were 20 and 18% greater  respectively  in null allele mice compared with wild-type mice  while responses to nonbenzodiazepine agents such as etomidate and pentobarbital were unchanged. Although the GABA(A) receptor number was not altered in null allele mice  there was a corresponding increase in affinity of brain membranes for benzodiazepine agonists (midazolam  diazepam  and zolpidem)  while affinity for benzodiazepine inverse agonists (beta CCM and Ro15-4513) was decreased. These changes were not observed in inbred mice of the parental strains (C57BL/6J and 129/SvJ) used to create the genetically altered mice  indicating that differences between gamma 2L null allele and wild-type mice were unlikely to be simply due to cosegregation of linked alleles. Absence of the gamma 2L splice variant increases the affinity of receptors for benzodiazepine agonists  and is associated with a modest increase in behavioral sensitivity to benzodiazepine agonists. Lack of the gamma 2L subunits may shift the GABA(A) receptor from an inverse agonist-preferring toward an agonist-preferring configuration."

This study examined how selective knock-down (via antisense oligodeoxynucleotides  aODNs) of GABA(A) receptor subunits modified antidepressant activity. The specific aODNs used were for the alpha1  beta1  beta2 or gamma2 subunits of the GABA(A) receptor. The aODN microinjections reduced corresponding GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA levels by 30-40% as assessed by RT-PCR. The inhibitory effect of the antidepressants amitriptyline and mianserin on GABA-stimulated 36Cl(-) influx was decreased after microinjections of alpha1  beta1  or beta2 subunit aODNs but potentiated after microinjections of gamma2 subunit aODNs. This pattern of aODNs effect on amitriptyline and mianserin modulation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl(-) influx was the same for both antidepressants and similar to GABA but different than that of diazepam and bicuculline. We conclude that multiple subunits of the GABA(A) receptor regulate the effect of amitriptyline and mianserin on the GABA(A) receptor chloride ionophore complex. However  the exact identity of the subunit mediating the direct or allosteric modulation of the antidepressant effect on GABA-stimulated 36Cl(-) influx remains unclear."

DCS  2.5 mg/kg i.p. did not significantly affect the occurrence of audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice  but potentiated the anticonvulsant activity of carbamazepine  diazepam  felbamate  lamotrigine  phenytoin  phenobarbital and valproate against sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice. The degree of potentiation induced by DCS was greatest for diazepam  phenobarbital  phenytoin and valproate  less for carbamazepine and least for lamotrigine and felbamate. The increase in anticonvulsant activity was usually associated with a comparable increase in motor impairment. However  the therapeutic index of the combined treatment of the above drugs+DCS  was more favourable than the same drugs+saline with the exception of DCS+carbamazepine and DCS+lamotrigine. Since DCS did not significantly influence the total and free plasma levels of the anticonvulsant drugs studied  pharmacokinetic interactions  in terms of plasma levels  are not probable. The possibility that DCS can modify the clearance from the brain of the anticonvulsant drugs studied cannot be excluded. DCS did not significantly affect the hypothermic effects of the anticonvulsants tested. In conclusion  DCS potentiates the anticonvulsant action of some classical antiepileptic drugs  most notably diazepam  phenobarbital  phenytoin and valproate."

A synthetic pathway for the production of benzodiazepine-like compounds and endozepines has not yet been found  hence it may be surmised that these compounds could be of exogenous source. Changes in the level of endogenous circulating benzodiazepines due to food or drug ingestion could be responsible for pathological conditions. Clinical experiments were designed in order to study the levels of the endogenous benzodiazepines in vegetables and in the blood of control subjects and of cirrhotic patients.

Subcutaneous administration of KA (12 mg/kg) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats caused a progressive development of seizure behavior. An induction of the PACAP gene expression in the medial parvocellular part of the PVN (mpPVN) was observed 3  6  12  24 and 48 h after subcutaneous administration of KA. From a nearly undetectable level  PACAP gene expression increased in the mpPVN and reached maximum 12 h after subcutaneous administration of KA. PACAP gene expression returned to near basal level 48 h after stimulation with KA. Using a specific monoclonal PACAP antibody  PACAP immunoreactivity (-IR) gradually increased during the following 24 h after KA administration. In controls  PACAP-IR was located exclusively in nerve fibers of the mpPVN  whereas KA administration induced PACAP-IR in cell bodies of the mpPVN  and a dense accumulation of PACAP-IR nerve fibers in the external zone of the median eminence was observed. Induction of the PACAP gene expression following KA-induced seizure was significantly reduced by pretreatment with diazepam or MK-801 (nonselective N-methly-D-aspartate receptor antagonist).

The post-mitochondrial fraction (PMF) showed a significant increase in GR activity in cerebrum. Enhancement of total and free thiol levels was observed in cerebrum and cerebellum whereas in BS free thiols were not enhanced. It was interesting to note that in the animals withdrawn from the drug and sacrificed after an interval of 7 days  the level of TBARS showed a highly significant increase in mitochondria of CB and CBL and 89% increase in BS. Similar trend was observed in the post-mitochondrial fractions of all the 3 regions whereas the activity of isozymes of SOD decreased (p &lt; 0.001) in CBL and BS and to a lesser extent in CB. The GR activity was significantly decreased only in the mitochondria of cerebrum with a 34% rise in cerebellum and no change in BS. The PMFs showed a decrease in CB and CBL but a 20% rise in BS. Thus  the data show modulation of antioxidant responses during short-term administration of diazepam  and a lowering of peroxidative decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acids of membranes. However  after withdrawal of the drug  PUFAs were found to be more vulnerable to peroxidative decomposition and changes in the antioxidant defenses were also observed  which did not come back to normal level during the study."
"930","10832099","Differential effects of acyl-CoA binding protein on enzymatic and non-enzymatic thioacylation of protein and peptide substrates.","Both enzymatic and autocatalytic mechanisms have been proposed to account for protein thioacylation (commonly known as palmitoylation). Acyl-CoA binding proteins (ACBP) strongly suppress non-enzymatic thioacylation of cysteinyl-containing peptides by long-chain acyl-CoAs. At physiological concentrations of ACBP  acyl-CoAs  and membrane lipids  the rate of spontaneous acylation is expected to be too slow to contribute significantly to thioacylation of signaling proteins in mammalian cells (Leventis et al.  Biochemistry 36 (1997) 5546-5553). Here we characterized the effects of ACBP on enzymatic thioacylation. A protein S-acyltransferase activity previously characterized using G-protein alpha-subunits as a substrate (Dunphy et al.  J. Biol. Chem.  271 (1996) 7154-7159)  was capable of thioacylating short lipid-modified cysteinyl-containing peptides. The minimum requirements for substrate recognition were a free cysteine thiol adjacent to a hydrophobic lipid anchor  either myristate or farnesyl isoprenoid. PAT activity displayed specificity for the acyl donor  efficiently utilizing long-chain acyl-CoAs  but not free fatty acid or S-palmitoyl-N-acetylcysteamine. ACBP only modestly inhibited enzymatic thioacylation of a myristoylated peptide or G-protein alpha-subunits under conditions where non-enzymatic thioacylation was reduced to background. Thus  protein S-acyltransferase remains active in the presence of physiological concentrations of ACBP and acyl-CoA in vitro and is likely to represent the predominant mechanism of thioacylation in vivo."

These effects were accompanied by decreases in the efficacies of diazepam and the beta-carboline DMCM with regard to modulation of GABA-evoked Cl(-) currents. Withdrawal from such progesterone treatment resulted in a rapid and selective increase in the abundance of the GABA(A) alpha(4) subunit mRNA that was associated with a restoration of receptor sensitivity to the negative modulatory action of DMCM  a positive receptor response to flumazenil  and continued reduced responsiveness of receptors to diazepam. Prevention of allopregnanolone synthesis by the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride also prevented the changes in both GABA(A) receptor gene expression and receptor function elicited by progesterone treatment and withdrawal."

Here  the effects of naloxone on rat brain GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor function in vitro were investigated. Naloxone  naltrexone and morphine (10-1 000 microM) reduced GABA-induced (10 microM) 36Cl- uptake in corticohippocampal synaptoneurosomes. Furthermore  the concentration-response curve for GABA-induced 36Cl- uptake (GABA 3-100 microM) was shifted to the right both by naloxone and morphine (1 000 microM). Naloxone also reduced the 36Cl- uptake induced by GABA + diazepam (3 microM + 1 microM) but not that induced by amobarbital (500 microM). The naloxone-induced (1 000 microM) reduction of GABA-mediated (10 microM) 36Cl- uptake was reversed by amobarbital (10-1 000 microM) but not by flumazenil (10-1 000 microM) or morphine (0.1-1 000 microM). These results indicate that naloxone  naltrexone and morphine are weak negative modulators of GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor function. The naloxone effect most likely does not involve opiate receptors or the benzodiazepine site on GABA(A) receptor complexes."

The properties of the resulting ion currents were characterized by using electrophysiological techniques. The concentration-response curve of the channel agonist GABA for alpha1alpha6beta2gamma2 showed a single apparent component characterized by an EC(50) of 107 +/- 26 microM (n = 4). It was different from the one for alpha1beta2gamma2  which had an EC(50) of 41 +/- 9 microM (n = 4)  that for alpha6beta2gamma2  with an EC(50) of 6.7 +/- 1.9 microM (n = 5)  and those for alpha1beta2 and alpha1alpha6beta2. There was no appreciable functional expression of alpha6beta2. Allosteric responses of alpha1alpha6beta2gamma2 to diazepam were intermediate to those of alpha1beta2gamma2 and alpha6beta2gamma2  and allosteric responses to flumazenil were comparable to the ones for alpha1beta2gamma2. The inhibition by furosemide of the currents elicited by GABA in alpha1alpha6beta2gamma2 [IC(50) = 298 +/- 116 microM (n = 7)  assuming only one component] was not identical with inhibition of alpha6beta2gamma2 (IC(50) = 38 +/- 2 microM  n = 4)  alpha1beta2gamma2 (IC(50) = 5 610 +/- 910 microM  n = 5)  or a mixture of these components (assuming two components). These findings indicate unambiguously the formation of functional GABA(A) receptors containing two different alpha subunits  alpha1 and alpha6  with properties different from those of alpha1beta2gamma2 and alpha6beta2gamma2. Furthermore  we provide evidence for the facts that in the Xenopus oocyte (a) the formation of the different receptor types depends on the relative abundance of cRNAs coding for the different receptor subunits and (b) that functional dual subunit combinations alphabeta do not form in the presence of cRNA coding for the gamma subunit."
"934","10816315","Sedative but not anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines are mediated by the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subtype.","Inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain is largely mediated by GABA(A) receptors. Potentiation of GABA receptor activation through an allosteric benzodiazepine (BZ) site produces the sedative  anxiolytic  muscle relaxant  anticonvulsant and cognition-impairing effects of clinically used BZs such as diazepam. We created genetically modified mice (alpha1 H101R) with a diazepam-insensitive alpha1 subtype and a selective BZ site ligand  L-838 417  to explore GABA(A) receptor subtypes mediating specific physiological effects. These two complimentary approaches revealed that the alpha1 subtype mediated the sedative  but not the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines. This finding suggests ways to improve anxiolytics and to develop drugs for other neurological disorders based on their specificity for GABA(A) receptor subtypes in distinct neuronal circuits."
"935","10811003","Diazepam-binding inhibitor-derived peptides induce intracellular calcium changes and modulate human neutrophil function.","We studied the effects of two diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI)-derived peptides  triakontatetraneuropeptide (DBI 17-50  TTN) and eiksoneuropeptide (DBI 51-70  ENP)  on cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i)  chemotaxis  superoxide anion (O2-) generation  and phagocytosis in human neutrophils. Both TTN and ENP induced a rapid and transient rise of [Ca2+]i. The effect of TTN depended on the presence of extracellular Ca2+  whereas the effect of ENP also persisted after extracellular Ca2+ chelation. TTN induced neutrophil chemotaxis  stimulated O2- generation  and enhanced phagocytosis. ENP did not affect cell migration and oxidative metabolism but enhanced phagocytosis. Both peptides modulated N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine- and phorbol myristate acetate-induced O2- generation. Because neutrophils express benzodiazepine receptors of the peripheral type (pBRs) and DBI-derived peptides may interact with such receptors  we investigated the possible role of pBRs in TTN- or ENP-induced effects. The synthetic pBR ligand RO 5-4864 increased [Ca2+]i through extracellular Ca2+ influx and this effect was prevented by the pBR antagonist PK-11195. RO 5-4864  however  was ineffective on neutrophil migration and O2- generation and only slightly affected phagocytosis. Moreover  PK-11195 delayed the [Ca2+]i rise induced by TTN but did not significantly affect its extent  and had no effect on the [Ca2+]i rise induced by ENP. We conclude that DBI-derived peptides induce [Ca2+]i changes and modulate neutrophil function mainly through pBR-independent pathways. In view of the wide cell and tissue distribution of DBI in the brain and in peripheral organs  modulation of neutrophil function by DBI-derived peptides may be relevant for both the neuroimmune network and the development and regulation of the inflammatory processes."

Controls received only solvent (carboxymethylcellulose 1%). Six hours after the last force-feeding  the rats were subjected to 3 min ether inhalation or 30 min restraint and killed by decapitation 30 min after ether stress or at the end of restraint.RESULTS: Baseline plasma levels of ACTH  B  NA and A were not affected by either diazepam or PC60. Both ether- and restraint-induced release of ACTH  but not B  were similarly and drastically reduced by diazepam and PC60 (1 200 mg/kg). Both diazepam and PC60 (1 200 mg/kg) deleted restraint-induced NA and A increases. Both treatments also reduced the ether-induced rise of A. Basal levels of GABA were significantly increased in both the hippocampus and the hypothalamus in PC60-treated rats and only in the hippocampus in diazepam-treated ones. In controls  ether inhalation as well as restraint increased GABA content of these two brain structures. In contrast  such stress procedures performed in PC60-treated rats reduced GABA content slightly in the hippocampus but significantly in the hypothalamus. In diazepam-treated rats  GABA content of the hypothalamus was unaffected by stresses but that of the hippocampus was slightly decreased.CONCLUSIONS: Present data suggest diazepam-like effects of PC60 on stress responsiveness of the rat pituitary adrenal axis and the sympathoadrenal activity as well as GABA content of the hippocampus and the hypothalamus under resting and stress conditions. These effects of PC60 agree with anxiolytic properties of this nutritional supplement  previously reported in both rats and humans."

Pg  Diaz and DICLO per se did not modify brain and hypothalamic 5-HT in control rats. But they attenuated stress-induced elevation of brain and hypothalamic 5-HT. Anti-stress action of both Pg and Diaz reflected by inhibition of stress-induced elevation of brain and hypothalamic content of 5-HT as also stress-induced concurrent elevation of plasma corticosterone were further diminished by DICLO. The mediatory action of 5-HT in anti-stress effects of Pg and Diaz may be modulated through prostaglandins."

The combined effect of L-arginine and diazepam was also tested against picrotoxin-induced convulsions. Picrotoxin-induced increase in ammonia was reverted partially by L-arginine pretreatment. However  L-arginine pretreatment did not show anticonvulsant effect independently or concurrently with diazepam. On the other hand  L-arginine post-treatment reverted ammonia to control level in all brain regions. A partial but significant inhibition of convulsion responses was found in these animals. The combined effect of diazepam and L-arginine post-treatment was much greater than that produced by these agents independently. These findings suggest that ammonia has a partial but significant participation in the convulsant action of picrotoxin. L-arginine has a potential to revert brain ammonia to control level in picrotoxin-treated animals and thereby it has produced a partial protection. The data further indicate that the duration of action of L-arginine is considerably short and has an additive anticonvulsant action with diazepam."

We investigated the effects of analgesics on the increase in central cholinergic activity and writhing responses elicited by i.p. injection of acetic acid. ACh efflux from the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus was measured in the absence of a cholinesterase inhibitor using an in vivo microdialysis technique and a highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay. ACh efflux from the cerebral cortex was significantly increased during the first 30 min after acetic acid injection and then returned to the control levels. In contrast  acetic acid-induced writhing responses  indicative of the perception of pain  persisted for almost the entire 120 min observation period. No changes in ACh efflux were observed in the hippocampus. The centrally-acting analgesic morphine and the peripherally-acting analgesic indomethacin each completely abolished the enhanced cerebral cortical ACh efflux and the writhing  whereas diazepam  a muscle relaxant  selectively suppressed only the writhing. These results demonstrate that peripheral nociceptive stimulation transiently increases cholinergic activity in the cerebral cortex  but not in the hippocampus  and that analgesics suppress both the enhanced ACh efflux and the writhing induced by acetic acid."

Pilocarpine was administered systemically (380mg/kg i.p.) to induce status epilepticus. The duration of status epilepticus was controlled to last 1h by stopping it with diazepam (4mg/kg i.p.). The progression of cellular damage was quantified at six specific time points following the initial pilocarpine-induced insult: 3h  6h  12h  24h  one week  and three weeks. To assess  in parallel  neuronal loss in specific hippocampal regions throughout epileptogenesis  the neuronal nuclear protein NeuN was used as a specific marker of neurons. Results revealed a different time-dependent progression of Dark Neuron and Fluoro-Jade labelling following status epilepticus. A significantly greater proportion of silver-impregnated cells labelled by the Dark Neuron stain was quantified in the stratum radiatum and stratum pyramidale of CA1 at the early time point of 3h compared with the proportion of Fluoro-Jade labelling in adjacent sections. In contrast  the maximal staining with Fluoro-Jade appeared at a later stage during epileptogenesis (between 24h and one week)  with a significantly greater proportion of neurons labelled compared to the Dark Neuron stain in the stratum radiatum of CA1  stratum pyramidale of CA1  stratum radiatum of CA3 and the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. Neurons from control animals were not significantly labelled by either of the two staining methods. Interestingly  the increase in Fluoro-Jade labelling corresponded in time to neuron loss. The two stains therefore appear to highlight separate processes of neuronal damage. This finding indicates that distinct cellular events take place at different stages of epileptogenesis  which may differ considerably from the permanent changes observed in chronically epileptic tissue."

We investigated the effects of 7-nitroindazole at a dose of 25 mg kg(-1) i.p.  which per se did not show anticonvulsant activity against audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice  on the antiseizure activity of some conventional antiepileptic drugs. 7-Nitroindazole sometimes potentiated the anticonvulsant activity of carbamazepine  diazepam  lamotrigine  phenytoin  phenobarbital and valproate against audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice. The degree of potentiation by 7-nitroindazole was greatest for phenobarbital and diazepam  less for valproate and least for carbamazepine  lamotrigine and phenytoin. The increase in anticonvulsant activity was associated with a comparable increase in motor impairment. However  the therapeutic index of combined treatment with diazepam+7-nitroindazole  phenobarbital+7-nitroindazole or valproate+7-nitroindazole was more favourable than that of the diazepam+vehicle  phenobarbital+vehicle or valproate+vehicle treatment. The results indicate that 7-nitroindazole is able to increase the protective activity of some conventional antiepileptics and this effect appears not to result only from the impaired synthesis of nitric oxide. In fact  mice receiving 7-nitroindazole (25 mg kg(-1)  i.p.) and L-arginine (30 microg/mouse  intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) did not show significant changes of ED(50) values in comparison to those of related groups of animals treated with 7-nitroindazole and anticonvulsants. 7-Nitroindazole was able to increase the brain levels of dopamine and noradrenaline and its anticonvulsant effects and changes in catecholamine content were antagonized by pretreatment with alpha-methyl-paratyrosine  an agent inhibiting the synthesis of catecholamines. The fact that alpha-methyl-paratyrosine reverses concomitantly both the increase in brain levels of dopamine and noradrenaline and the anticonvulsant properties of 7-nitroindazole strongly suggests an important role of catecholamines in the antiseizure activity of 7-nitroindazole. Since 7-nitroindazole did not significantly influence the total and free plasma levels of the anticonvulsant drugs studied  we suggest that pharmacokinetic interactions  in terms of total or free plasma levels  are not probable. 7-Nitroindazole did not significantly affect the hypothermic effects of the anticonvulsant compounds studied. 7-Nitroindazole showed an additive effect when administered in combination with some classical anticonvulsants  most notably diazepam  phenobarbital and valproate and its activity could be  in part  due to an increase of monoamine levels."
"942","10764909","Ricinine-elicited seizures. A novel chemical model of convulsive seizures.","The present investigation introduces ricinine-elicited seizures as a novel chemical model of convulsive seizure. Ricinine  a neutral alkaloid obtained from the plant Ricinus communis  induces seizures when administered to mice at doses higher than 20 mg/kg. Animals presenting seizures showed a marked preconvulsive phase followed by short duration hind limb myoclonus  respiratory spasms  and death. The lethal nature of ricinine seizures is also pointed out as a good model to study the events causing death in clonic seizures  particularly those related to respiratory spasms  which are also observed in some types of human epilepsy. The behavioral signs of ricinine-elicited seizures are accompanied by electrographic alterations more evident during the preconvulsive phase in the cerebral cortex and more intense during the ictal phase both in the cortex and in the hippocampus. The ricinine-elicited seizures may be inhibited by diazepam but not by phenobarbital  phenytoin  or ethosuximide. Micromolar concentrations of ricinine cause a small decrease in the binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam to cerebral cortex membranes  but do not alter the binding of other radioligands to AMPA  5-HT(1A)  muscarinic  and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. Although ricinine presents a cyanide radical  only higher doses of ricinine (4 mM) caused a small impairment of mitochondrial respiration. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of ricinine probably involves the benzodiazepine site in the GABA(A) receptor. This may represent a new mechanism of drug-elicited seizures that may contribute to a better understanding of epilepsy and to new therapeutic approaches to this disease."

There is also evidence that the noradrenergic projection from the locus coeruleus to the posterior hypothalamus contributes to the development of genetic hypertension. To investigate whether the release of noradrenaline and dopamine in the locus coeruleus is modified in genetic hypertension  this brain region of adult SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats was superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid through a push-pull cannula. Dopamine and noradrenaline released in the superfusate were determined radioenzymatically. There was no difference in the basal release of noradrenaline and dopamine in the locus coeruleus of conscious  anaesthetized or diazepam-treated adult WKY rats and SHR. In conscious animals  a rise in blood pressure elicited by intravenous infusion of phenylephrine enhanced the release of noradrenaline and dopamine in both strains to the same extent. Intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside elicited a fall in blood pressure and also increased to the same degree the release of noradrenaline and dopamine in the locus coeruleus of normotensive and hypertensive conscious rats. In anaesthetized rats  baroreceptor activation by phenylephrine decreased the release of noradrenaline and dopamine  while sodium nitroprusside lowered blood pressure and enhanced the release rates of the two catecholamines. Treatment of conscious rats with diazepam (10 mg/kg  i.p.  120 min prior to starting collection of the superfusate) abolished the phenylephrine-evoked release of catecholamines observed in conscious animals. The sensory stimulus tail pinch led to a slight increase in blood pressure. In conscious animals  this aversive stimulus led to enhanced release of noradrenaline and dopamine that lasted longer in SHR than in WKY rats. The release of catecholamines evoked by tail pinch was abolished in rats treated with diazepam  as well as in anaesthetized animals. Our findings show that in adult rats  genetic hypertension does not modify the release of noradrenaline and dopamine in the locus coeruleus. Since in anaesthetized rats increases in blood pressure diminish  while decreases in blood pressure enhance  the release of noradrenaline and dopamine  it seems that both amines possess a counteracting  hypertensive function in the rat locus coeruleus. When baroreceptor activation by phenylephrine is carried out on conscious animals  stress predominates and the release of catecholamines is enhanced. This study demonstrates the importance of the noradrenergic system of the locus coeruleus in central cardiovascular control and in emotional  stress and pain-regulating processes."

A separate experiment showed that consumption of a sucrose solution immediately prior to precipitated withdrawal resulted in a decreased subsequent consumption of the sucrose solution; no such evidence of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) was seen in mice given prior experience of withdrawal. Thus  prior experience of withdrawal enhanced the effects of a subsequent precipitated withdrawal in increasing seizure sensitivity  but weakened the ability of this withdrawal to serve as an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US). The weakening of the aversive properties of precipitated withdrawal may reflect habituation to the withdrawal stimulus  and was accompanied by a loss of the ability of withdrawal to induce c-fos expression in the shell of the nucleus accumbens  an area sensitive to both novel  and stressful  as well as rewarding stimuli."

It is a full agonist at these receptors and elicits dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effects in a set of validated models of distinct types of anxiety states in the rat (i.e.  elevated plus-maze  fear-potentiated startle  and operant conflict). When given systemically  the compound has an efficacy and potency comparable to those of a benzodiazepine anxiolytic such as alprazolam or diazepam. However  this compound is differentiated from a classical benzodiazepine anxiolytic by a lack of efficient anti-panic-like activity  absence of anticonvulsant properties  and lack of effects on motor performance and cognitive function at anxiolytic doses (0.3 to 3 mg/kg i.p.). No significant change in intracranial self-stimulation performance and pain reactivity was observed in this dose range. Higher doses of this compound (&gt;/=10 mg/kg) induced disruption in rat behavior.

Lamotrigine produced dose-dependent inhibitory effects on seizure stage  afterdischarge (AD)  and seizure duration. Lamotrigine (15 mg/kg) also increased the afterdischarge and seizure thresholds. Following repeated LTG administration and stimulation at 48-h intervals  tolerance developed to LTG's (15 mg/kg) anticonvulsant effects  and cross-tolerance was observed to the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine (CBZ  15 mg/kg). In a separate group of kindled rats  CBZ (15 mg/kg) was repeatedly administered to induce tolerance. This led to a partial cross-tolerance to LTG  manifesting as an increased rate of tolerance development to LTG  and seizures following the first injection in some animals  which were not observed in CBZ-nontolerant controls. When these rats were made fully tolerant to LTG and then exposed to higher doses of LTG (30 and 50 mg/kg)  no anticonvulsant effects were observed. In contrast  higher doses of CBZ (30 mg/kg) did restore efficacy in CBZ-tolerant animals. Cross-tolerance from LTG to valproate and diazepam was not observed  although cross-tolerance from CBZ to valproate has been reported previously. These data suggest that LTG has both shared and distinct anticonvulsant mechanisms from those of CBZ on amygdala-kindled seizures.

LY354740 (4-16 mg/kg) administered prior to an injection of pentylenetetrazol (80 mg/kg) or picrotoxin (3.2 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent decrease in the number of mice exhibiting clonic convulsions  but had no effect on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA  150 mg/kg)-induced convulsions. LY354740 (4-16 mg/kg) did not affect lethality induced in mice by pentylenetetrazol  picrotoxin or NMDA. LY354740 potentiated the anticonvulsant activity of the conventional antiepileptic drug diazepam  significantly decreasing the ED50 for that drug's effect on pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions by 30%  but had no influence on anticonvulsant activity of ethosuximide and valproic acid. A pharmacokinetic interaction between LY354740 and diazepam  leading to the lowering of the plasma level of free diazepam  was also demonstrated. Our data suggest that the group II mGluR agonist LY354740 possesses anti-seizure activity and may modify the effects of some conventional antiepileptic drugs."

To investigate whether activity in the amygdaloid complex is altered with anxiolytic effects of diazepam  mRNA expression of the immediate-early gene EGR-1 was examined in the amygdala following blockade of fear conditioning by diazepam. It was previously shown that mRNA expression of EGR-1 (also called  NGFI-A  Zif 268  Krox 24) increases in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) shortly following contextual fear conditioning. It was therefore hypothesized that diazepam would block both contextual fear and the concomitant increase in EGR-1 mRNA expression in the LA induced by fear conditioning. Rats administered systemic diazepam before fear conditioning displayed both anxiolytic effects during the post-shock period and amnesic effects during a retention test 24 h later. Diazepam blocked the fear-conditioning-induced increase in EGR-1 expression in the LA. In addition  diazepam significantly increased EGR-1 mRNA expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in a dose-dependent manner. The results reveal differential regulation of EGR-1 by diazepam in the central and lateral nuclei of the amygdala suggesting that these two amygdala nuclei act in a reciprocal manner during the anxiolytic and amnesic action of the benzodiazepine agonist."
"951","10725394","Alpha-thujone (the active component of absinthe): gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor modulation and metabolic detoxification.","Alpha-thujone is the toxic agent in absinthe  a liqueur popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries that has adverse health effects. It is also the active ingredient of wormwood oil and some other herbal medicines and is reported to have antinociceptive  insecticidal  and anthelmintic activity. This study elucidates the mechanism of alpha-thujone neurotoxicity and identifies its major metabolites and their role in the poisoning process. Four observations establish that alpha-thujone is a modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor. First  the poisoning signs (and their alleviation by diazepam and phenobarbital) in mice are similar to those of the classical antagonist picrotoxinin. Second  a strain of Drosophila specifically resistant to chloride channel blockers is also tolerant to alpha-thujone. Third  alpha-thujone is a competitive inhibitor of [(3)H]ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate binding to mouse brain membranes. Most definitively  GABA-induced peak currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons are suppressed by alpha-thujone with complete reversal after washout. alpha-Thujone is quickly metabolized in vitro by mouse liver microsomes with NADPH (cytochrome P450) forming 7-hydroxy-alpha-thujone as the major product plus five minor ones (4-hydroxy-alpha-thujone  4-hydroxy-beta-thujone  two other hydroxythujones  and 7 8-dehydro-alpha-thujone)  several of which also are detected in the brain of mice treated i.p. with alpha-thujone. The major 7-hydroxy metabolite attains much higher brain levels than alpha-thujone but is less toxic to mice and Drosophila and less potent in the binding assay. The other metabolites assayed are also detoxification products. Thus  alpha-thujone in absinthe and herbal medicines is a rapid-acting and readily detoxified modulator of the GABA-gated chloride channel."
"952","10724170","Inhibitory threshold for critical-period activation in primary visual cortex.","Neuronal circuits across several systems display remarkable plasticity to sensory input during postnatal development. Experience-dependent refinements are often restricted to well-defined critical periods in early life  but how these are established remains mostly unknown. A representative example is the loss of responsiveness in neocortex to an eye deprived of vision. Here we show that the potential for plasticity is retained throughout life until an inhibitory threshold is attained. In mice of all ages lacking an isoform of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) synthetic enzyme (GAD65)  as well as in immature wild-type animals before the onset of their natural critical period  benzodiazepines selectively reduced a prolonged discharge phenotype to unmask plasticity. Enhancing GABA-mediated transmission early in life rendered mutant animals insensitive to monocular deprivation as adults  similar to normal wild-type mice. Short-term presynaptic dynamics reflected a synaptic reorganization in GAD65 knockout mice after chronic diazepam treatment. A threshold level of inhibition within the visual cortex may thus trigger  once in life  an experience-dependent critical period for circuit consolidation  which may otherwise lie dormant."
"953","10717431","Developmental change of GABA(A) receptor-mediated current in rat hippocampus.","Developmental change of GABA(A)ergic inhibitory postsynaptic current in rat hippocampal CA3 region was examined using patch-clamp recording method. Spontaneous and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents were recorded from acute hippocampal slices of neonates (postnatal days 2-4) and adults (days 18-38). Decay kinetics of the spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current was slower in neonates than in adults. Application of 500 nM zolpidem increased decay time-constants of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents in both groups with a stronger effect on adults. Zinc (50 microM) inhibited the neonatal inhibitory postsynaptic currents but the inhibition was weaker in adults. Modification of the GABA(A)ergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents by furosemide (0.6 mM) or diazepam (100 nM) did not cause marked differences between the neonate and adult groups. These results demonstrate that GABA(A)ergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells change developmentally and indicate that different receptor isoforms are functionally expressed between neonates and adults."

In diazepam chronically treated mice  it attenuated diazepam tolerance (provoked by later acute administration of diazepam together with convulsant) and postponed physical dependence/withdrawal effects (provoked by later administration of isoniazid). In tolerance assay  at 42 h after the end of conditioning regimen  shorter preconvulsive latencies than in healthy (non-diazepam conditioned) mice following isoniazid (800 mg/kg i.p.) (as hallmark of tolerance) were observed if diazepam (5.0 mg/kg i.p.) was again given acutely to mice previously conditioned with diazepam alone (use of picrotoxin 3.0 mg/kg i.p.  as convulsant  with acute application of diazepam in previously diazepam conditioned mice did not lead to tolerance hallmark). This was completely avoided in diazepam+BPC 157 10 microg or diazepam+BPC 157 10 ng chronically treated animals. In physical dependence assay (isoniazid challenge assessed at 6  14  42 and 72 h after conditioning medication)  when compared to diazepam non-conditioned healthy mice  in diazepam conditioned mice residual anticonvulsive activity was not present already at the earliest post-conditioning interval (i.e.  not different latency to isoniazid-convulsions)  whereas shorter preconvulsive latencies (as physical dependence/withdrawal hallmark) were noted in diazepam conditioned mice following isoniazid challenge at 42 h and at 72 h after end of conditioning treatment. In diazepam+BPC 157 10 microg- conditioned mice  a residual anticonvulsive activity (i.e.  longer latency to isoniazid convulsion) was noted at 6 h post-conditioning  whereas shorter preconvulsive latencies appeared only at 72 h-post-conditioning period. In conclusion  taken together these data (lack of tolerance development (tolerance studies)  prolonged residual anticonvulsive activity  and postponed physical dependence/withdrawal hallmark in diazepam+BPC 157 chronically treated mice) with common benzodiazepines tolerance/withdrawal knowledge  it could be speculated that BPC 157 acts favoring the natural homeostasis of the GABA receptor complex as well as enhancing the GABAergic transmission  and having a mechanism at least partly different from those involved in diazepam tolerance/withdrawal  it may be likely used in further therapy of diazepam tolerance and withdrawal."

Several reports have indicated that anti-epileptic drugs (AED) affect the immune system  but the mechanism has not been clear. We examined whether the commonly used AEDs  diazepam (DZP)  carbamazepine (CBZ)  phenobarbital (PB)  phenytoin (PHT)  and VPA  can inhibit activation of the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)  in human monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) and in human glioma cells (A-172). NF-kappaB is essential to the expression of the kappa light chain of immunoglobulin and proinflammatory cytokines. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) of nuclear extracts demonstrated that VPA inhibits NF-kappaB activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)  but the other AEDs do not. Western blot analysis revealed that this inhibition is not linked to preservation of expression of IkappaBalpha protein. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay indicated that NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression is suppressed in glioma cells pretreated with VPA. VPA significantly inhibited LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by THP-1 cells  whereas other AEDs did not. The findings are consistent with the idea that VPA suppresses TNF-alpha and IL-6 production via inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Our results suggest that VPA can modulate immune responses in vitro. These findings raise the possibility that such modulation might occur with clinical use of VPA."

We have previously shown that GABA  acting through GABA(A) receptors  modulates both the electrical and secretory activities of frog pituitary melanotrophs. The aim of the present study was to take advantage of the frog melanotroph model to determine the relationship between the subunit composition and the pharmacological properties of native GABA(A) receptors. Immunohistochemical labeling revealed that in situ and in cell culture  frog melanotrophs were intensely stained with alpha2-  alpha3-  gamma2-  and gamma3-subunit antisera and weakly stained with a gamma1-subunit antiserum. Melanotrophs were also immunolabeled with a monoclonal antibody to the beta2/beta3-subunit. In contrast  frog melanotrophs were not immunoreactive for the alpha1-  alpha5-  and alpha6-isoforms. The effects of allosteric modulators of the GABA(A) receptor on GABA-activated chloride current were tested using the patch-clamp technique. Among the ligands acting at the benzodiazepine-binding site  clonazepam (EC50  5 x 10(-9) M)  diazepam (EC50  10(-8) M)  zolpidem (EC50  3 x 10(-8) M)  and beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (EC50  10(-6) M) were found to potentiate the whole cell GABA-evoked current in a dose-dependent manner. Methyl-6 7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (IC50  3 x 10(-5) M) inhibited the current  whereas Ro15-4513 had no effect. Among the ligands acting at other modulatory sites  etomidate (EC50  2 x 10(-6) M) enhanced the GABA-evoked current  whereas 4'-chlorodiazepam (IC50  4 x 10(-7) M)  ZnCl2 (IC50  &gt;5 x 10(-5) M)  and furosemide (IC50  &gt;3 x 10(-4) M) depressed the response to GABA. PK 11195 did not affect the GABA-evoked current or its inhibition by 4'-chlorodiazepam. The results indicate that the native GABA(A) receptors in frog melanotrophs are formed by combinations of alpha2-  alpha3-  beta2/3-  gamma1-  gamma2-  and gamma3-subunits. The data also demonstrate that clonazepam is the most potent  and zolpidem is the most efficient positive modulator of the native receptors. Among the inhibitors  4'-chlorodiazepam is the most potent  whereas ZnCl2 is the most efficient negative modulator of the GABA(A) receptors. The present study provides the first correlation between subunit composition and the functional properties of native GABA(A) receptors in nontumoral endocrine cells."

Seizures were induced by intraamygdaloid injection of kainic acid (0.1 microg) and were terminated after 45 min by diazepam (30 mg/kg) administration. Animals were killed 0-72 h following diazepam administration. Levels of the 32-kDa proenzyme form of caspase-3 were unaffected by seizures. Levels of the 17-kDa cleaved (active) fragment of caspase-3 were almost undetectable in control brain  but were increased significantly at 4 and 24 h within ipsilateral hippocampus and cortex in seizure animals. Caspase-3-like protease activity was increased within the ipsilateral hippocampus at 8 and 24 h following seizures. Caspase-3 immunoreactivity was increased within the vulnerable ipsilateral CA3/CA4 subfield at 24 and 72 h following seizures and was associated predominantly  but not exclusively  with neurons exhibiting DNA fragmentation. The putatively selective caspase-3 inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone significantly improved neuronal survival bilaterally within the hippocampal CA3/CA4 subfields following seizures. Collectively  these data suggest that caspase-3 may play a significant role in the mechanism by which neurons die following seizures."

Benzodiazepines inhibit adenosine metabolism by blocking nucleoside transporter. Therefore  the authors studied the binding affinities of structurally different benzodiazepines to nucleoside transporter and benzodiazepine-induced potentiation of A1-adenosine (negative dromotropy) and A2A-adenosine (coronary vasodilation) receptor-mediated effects.METHODS: In membranes from porcine striatum and guinea pig ventricle  competition binding assays to displace [3H]nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside ([3H]NBMPR) from nucleoside transporter were performed using alprazolam  chlorodiazepoxide  diazepam  flurazepam  and midazolam. The augmentation by the most potent benzodiazepine of A1- and A2A-adenosine receptor-mediated responses  elicited by exogenous administration of adenosine or brief periods of global hypoxia  was subsequently studied in guinea pig Langendorff-perfused hearts.RESULTS: All benzodiazepines completely displaced [3H]NBMPR in a concentration-dependent manner with Hill coefficients not significantly different from unity in both striatal and ventricular membranes. Midazolam was the most potent inhibitor of nucleoside transporter (ventricle:pKi = 5.22+/-0.41  Ki = 6 microM). In isolated hearts  midazolam (5  10  20 microM) significantly augmented coronary flow in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of adenosine (30 nM)  an effect reversed by ZM 241385  a selective A2A-receptor antagonist. In contrast  midazolam did not increase the effect of adenosine (30 nM) on atrioventricular conduction. Similarly  midazolam potentiated A2A- but not A1-receptor-mediated effects of endogenous adenosine released during hypoxia.CONCLUSIONS: Structurally distinct benzodiazepines inhibit nucleoside transporter to different degrees. Midazolam selectively augments A2A- but not A1-receptor-mediated effects of adenosine by inhibiting nucleoside transporter."

To mimic a realistic situation of anxiolytic intervention  the treatment started 14 days after the beginning of psychosocial stress; at that time  the stress-induced behavioral and endocrine alterations had been established. The drug (5 mg/kg/day) was administered orally in the morning  while the psychosocial stress continued during the whole treatment period; the therapeutic action of diazepam treatment was followed across 7 days. Twenty-four hours after the last application serum concentrations of diazepam and its major metabolites were determined via HPLC. The results revealed concentrations of 7 ng/ml for diazepam  106 ng/ml for nordiazepam  22 ng/ml for temazepam  and 30 ng/ml for oxazepam. Treatment of subordinate animals with diazepam did not reveal a beneficial effect to any of the parameters studied. This contrasts to earlier findings showing that the behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations produced by this stress paradigm are sensitive to chronic treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine. The present results support the view that in male tree shrews the state induced by psychosocial stress might be more depression related than anxiety related."

Using proteome analysis we previously compared the hippocampal proteome  that is  those proteins expressed by the hippocampal genome  of seven schizophrenic individuals with the hippocampal proteome of seven control individuals  matched for age and post mortem delay.1 We found 18 proteins that were significantly altered in concentration in the schizophrenic hippocampus (P &lt; 0.05)  when compared to control tissue. One of these proteins was characterised  by N-terminal sequencing  as diazepam binding inhibitor whose gene maps to 6q12-q21. Here we characterise a further three of the 18 proteins as: manganese superoxide dismutase  6q25.3  T-complex protein 1  6q25.3-q26 and collapsin response mediator protein 2  8p21. That three of these four characterised proteins should map to the long arm of the same chromosome is significant (P &lt; 0.002) and suggests the importance of chromosome 6q in schizophrenia.

The binding assays performed in rat striatal and cerebellar brain membranes showed that this compound has similar affinity to different populations of BDZ-BSs. Electrophysiological experiments revealed that 6-chloro-3'-nitroflavone did not affect GABA(A)-receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) responses recorded in Xenopus oocytes expressing alpha1beta2gamma2s subunits  but blocked the potentiation exerted by diazepam (DZ) on GABA-activated chloride currents.

Status epilepticus involves seizure activity recurring frequently enough to induce a sustained alteration in brain function. This study was initiated to investigate how status epilepticus affects the activity of calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II in the brain. Calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II is a neuronally enriched signal transducing system involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis and release  cytoskeletal function  gene transcription  neurotransmitter receptor function and neuronal excitability. Therefore  alteration of this signal transduction system would have significant physiological effects. Status epilepticus was induced in rats by pilocarpine injection  allowed to progress for 60 min and terminated by repeated diazepam injections. Animals were killed at specific time-points and examined for calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II activity. Calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II activity was significantly reduced in cerebral cortex and hippocampal homogenates obtained from status epilepticus rats when compared with control animals. Once established  the status epilepticus-induced inhibition of calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II activity was observed at all time-points tested following the termination of seizure activity. However  calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II activity was not significantly decreased in thalamus and cerebellar homogenates. In addition  status epilepticus-induced inhibition of calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II activity was dependent upon activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamatergic receptors. Thus  status epilepticus induced a significant inhibition of calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II activity that involves N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation. The data support the hypothesis that inhibition of calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II activity may be involved in the alteration of neuronal function following status epilepticus."

We used a transgenic mouse model  expressing a mouse Y1 receptor-beta-galactosidase fusion gene (Y1R/LacZ)  to study the effect of positive or negative modulators of GABA(A) receptors on Y1 receptor gene expression. Mice were treated for 14 days with diazepam (4 or 20 mg/kg)  the anxiolytic beta-carboline-derivative abecarnil (0.3 or 6 mg/kg) and the anxiogenic beta-carboline FG7142 (20 mg/kg). Transgene expression was determined by quantitative analysis of beta-galactosidase histochemical staining in the medial amygdala and in the medial habenula as a control region. Chronic treatment with 20 mg/kg diazepam or 6 mg/kg abecarnil significantly increased  whereas FG 7142 decreased  transgene expression in the medial amygdala. A transient decrease in transgene expression was observed in the medial amygdala six hours after the acute treatment with 20 mg/kg FG 7142 but not with diazepam or abecarnil.

The degree of potentiation induced by topiramate was greatest for diazepam  phenobarbital and valproate  less for lamotrigine and phenytoin and not significant for carbamazepine and felbamate. The increase in anticonvulsant activity was associated with a comparable increase in motor impairment. However  the therapeutic index of the combination of all drugs+topiramate was more favourable than that of antiepileptics+ saline  with the exception of carbamazepine or felbamate+topiramate. Since topiramate did not significantly influence the total and free plasma levels of the anticonvulsant drugs studied  we suggest that pharmacokinetic interactions  in terms of total or free plasma levels  are not probable. However  the possibility that topiramate can modify the clearance from the brain of the anticonvulsant drugs studied cannot be excluded. In addition  topiramate did not significantly affect the hypothermic effects of the anticonvulsants tested.

Immediately afterwards animals were decapitated and brain sections were frozen for subsequent HPLC-analysis of dopaminergic and serotonergic transmitter metabolism. Principal component factor analysis (PCA) of locomotion variables provided three factors explaining 78.5% of total variance. Variables related to the amount of locomotion loaded highly on Factor 1 (F1-Activity)  variables related to place utilization loaded highly on Factor 2 (F2-Exploration) and variables related to immobility and place preference loaded highly on Factor 3 (F3-Irritation). Apomorphine decreased F1-Activity with smaller effects in HAM and without changes in F2-Exploration and F3-Irritation independent on housing conditions. Diazepam exerted a decrease in F2-Exploration with a small increase in FI-Activity and no effects in F3-Irritation. Diazepam induced changes depended on housing conditions and were especially pronounced in isolated HAM. PCA of considerable locomotion and neurochemical data revealed interrelationships between striatal dopamine metabolism and F1-Activity  between cortical dopamine and serotonin metabolism and F2-Exploration as well as between cerebellar  hippocampal and striatal serotonin metabolism and F3-Irritation. The authors concluded that the application of PCA is a useful method to provide functionally relevant characteristics of behaviors and functionally relevant descriptions of interrrelationships between behavior and appropriate central nervous mechanisms.

NPY-LI content in the frontal cortex decreased after subchronic diazepam (3 mg/kg) treatment and slightly increased after buspirone. The study has shown that both diazepam and buspirone affect NPY-LI levels in rats. These results suggest that the NPY system in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens is implicated in the anxiolytic effects of the drugs studied."

Although the mechanism of action is unknown  significant evidence suggests that inhibition of LH release by chlorotriazines may be mediated by effects in the central nervous system. GABA(A) receptors are important for neuronal regulation of gonadotropin releasing hormone and LH release. The ability of chlorotriazine herbicides to interact with GABA(A) receptors was examined by measuring their effects on [3H]muscimol  [3H]Ro15-4513 and [35S]tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding to rat cortical membranes. Cyanazine (1-400 microM) inhibited [3H]Ro15-4513 binding with an IC50 of approximately 105 microM (n=4). Atrazine (1-400 microM) also inhibited [3H]Ro15-4513 binding  but was less potent than cyanazine (IC50 = 305 microM). However  the chlorotriazine metabolites diaminochlorotriazine  2-amino-4-chloro-6-ethylamino-s-triazine and 2-amino-4-chloro-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine were without significant effect on [3H]Ro15-4513 binding. Cyanazine and the other chlorotriazines were without effect on [3H]muscimol or [35S]TBPS binding. To examine whether cyanazine altered GABA(A) receptor function  GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux into synaptoneurosomes was examined. Cyanazine (50-100 microM) alone did not significantly decrease GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux. Diazepam (10 microM) and pentobarbital (100 microM) potentiated GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux to 126 and 166% of control  respectively. At concentrations of 50 and 100 microM  cyanazine decreased potentiation by diazepam to 112 and 97% of control  respectively  and decreased potentiation by pentobarbital to 158 and 137% of control (n = 6). Interestingly  at lower concentrations (5 microM)  cyanazine shifted the EC50 for GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux into synaptoneurosomes from 28.9 to 19.4 microM  respectively (n = 5). These results suggest that cyanazine modulates benzodiazepine  but not the muscimol (GABA receptor site) or TBPS (Cl- channel)  binding sites on GABA(A) receptors. Furthermore  at low concentrations  cyanazine may slightly enhance function of GABA(A) receptors  but at higher concentrations  cyanazine antagonizes GABA(A) receptor function and in particular antagonizes the positive modulatory effects of diazepam and pentobarbital."

This amitriptyline effect is opposite to the inhibition of GABA-stimulated 36Cl influx manifested in membrane vesicles prepared from drug-naive rats or submissive rats (a model of depression) but is similar to that seen in tissue from amitriptyline-treated rats or dominant rats. The results suggest a novel mechanism of antidepressant drug action having a delayed onset."
"971","10638645","Behavioral and hormonal effects of centrally injected &quot;anxiogenic&quot; neuropeptides in growing pigs.","Records of behavior (alertness  posture  oro-nasal responses  activity level  and vocalization pattern) were made in prepubertal pigs (n = 6) during a 60-min period following central injections of equimolar (21 nmol) doses of porcine CRH (pCRH)  urocortin (UCN)  octadecaneuropeptide (ODN)  or saline vehicle (SAL). Blood samples were also collected at 15-min intervals before  during  and after the test  and used to determine plasma cortisol  prolactin  and growth hormone concentrations. The pigs became excited and highly active after pCRH  and to a lesser extent following UCN administration  but were subdued when given ODN or SAL. None of the peptides significantly affected prolactin or growth hormone release  but both UCN  and especially pCRH  increased cortisol concentrations. The emotional responses induced by pCRH and UCN are consistent with observations in rodents  which indicate that centrally administered CRH-like peptides have anxiogenic effects. In contrast  ODN  which inhibits benzodiazepine binding at the GABA(A) receptor and is anxiogenic in rodents  lowered plasma cortisol and had no overt behavioral effects. Hence  at the dose administered  there was no evidence to indicate that ODN acted as an anxiogen in this species."
"972","10638633","Hypoexpression of benzodiazepine receptors in the amygdala of neophobic BALB/c mice compared to C57BL/6 mice.","The distribution of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain of neophobic BALB/c mice was studied by autoradiographic analysis using [3H]-diazepam and compared to that of the same receptors of the &quot;nonemotional&quot; C57BL/6 mice. This technique revealed no significant interstrain difference except for a lower density of diazepam binding sites in the amygdala of BALB/c mice. Therefore  the expression of benzodiazepine receptors in the amygdala of the two strains of mice were quantified by binding studies on brain membranes. The amygdala of BALB/c mice exhibited a fivefold decrease in the density of benzodiazepine receptors compared to C57BL/6 mice. These results suggest that the trait anxiety (neophobia) that characterizes BALB/c mice could be due  at least in part  to a genetic modulation of benzodiazepine receptor expression in the amygdala  a structure known to be strongly involved in fear behavior."

These compounds were designed as rigid analogues of the previously described N-benzylindolylglyoxylylamide derivatives IV. The title compounds V showed an affinity which depended directly on the presence of the N(10)-H group and an aromatic ring at position 3. Some of them elicited a 2- or 3-fold higher affinity with respect to that of the indolylglyoxylylamide derivatives IV (R = H). The GABA ratio and [(35)S]-tert-butylcyclophosphorothionate binding data revealed an efficacy profile of partial inverse agonists/antagonists for compounds 1c e f j k  and of a partial agonist for 2c. This last compound proved to be effective in antagonizing pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in mice. Attempts were made to interpret the structure-affinity relationships of compounds V in the light of possible tautomeric equilibria involving the ligands."
"974","10633039","Pharmacophore/receptor models for GABA(A)/BzR subtypes (alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha5beta3gamma2, and alpha6beta3gamma2) via a comprehensive ligand-mapping approach.","Pharmacophore/receptor models for three recombinant GABA(A)/BzR subtypes (alpha1beta3gamma2  alpha5beta3gamma2  and alpha6beta3gamma2) have been established via an SAR ligand-mapping approach. This study was based on the affinities of 151 BzR ligands at five distinct (alpha1-3 5 6beta3gamma2) recombinant GABA(A)/BzR receptor subtypes from at least nine different structural families. Examination of the included volumes of the alpha1-  alpha5-  and alpha6-containing subtypes indicated that region L(2) for the alpha5-containing subtype appeared to be larger in size than the analogous region of the other receptor subtypes. Region L(Di)  in contrast  appeared to be larger in the alpha1 subtype than in the other two subtypes. Moreover  region L(3) in the alpha6 subtype is either very small or nonexistent in this diazepam-insensitive subtype (see Figure 16 for details) as compared to the other subtypes. Use of the pharmacophore/receptor models for these subtypes has resulted in the design of novel BzR ligands (see 27) selective for the alpha5beta3gamma2 receptor subtype. alpha5-Selective ligand 27 when injected directly into the hippocampus did enhance memory in one paradigm (Bailey et al.  unpublished observations); however  systemic administration of either 9 or 27 into animals did not provide an observable enhancement. This result is in complete agreement with the observation of Liu (1996). It has been shown (Liu  1996; Wisden et al.  1992) that in the central nervous system of the rat (as well as monkeys and pigeons) there are several native subtypes of the GABA(A) receptor which exhibit different functions  regional distributions  and neuronal locations. Although 27 binds more potently at alpha5beta3gamma2 receptor subtypes and is clearly an inverse agonist (Liu et al.  1996; Liu  1996)  it is possible that this ligand acts as an agonist at one or more subtypes. Liu (1996) clearly showed that a number of imidazobenzodiazepines were negative modulators at one subtype and agonists at another. Therefore  selectivity for a particular subtype at this point is not sufficient to rule out some physiological effect at other GABA(A)/BzR subtypes. The inability of 27 to potentiate memory when given systemically is again in support of this hypothesis  especially since alpha1beta2gamma2 subtypes are distributed throughout the brain (Wisden et al.  1992). A drug delivered systemically is far more likely to interact with all subtypes than one delivered to a specific brain region. This observation (systemic vs intrahippocampal) provides further support for the design of more subtype-specific ligands at the BzR to accurately define their pharmacology  one key to the design of new drugs with fewer side effects."
"975","10618471","Activation of rat locus coeruleus neuron GABA(A) receptors by propofol and its potentiation by pentobarbital or alphaxalone.","The action of propofol on the rat locus coeruleus was examined using intracellular recording from in vitro brain slice preparations. Concentrations of propofol between 3 and 300 microM were tested. At 100 microM  propofol completely inhibited the firing of all neurons tested (n=34); this was associated with a 5.7-mV hyperpolarization (range 0-16 mV  n=33) and a 35.6% reduction in input resistance (range 7.3-66.1%  n=33). The propofol-induced responses were not affected by 2-hydroxysaclofen (50 microM) or BaCl(2) (300 microM)  but were completely blocked by bicuculline methiodide (100 microM) or picrotoxin (100 microM)  indicating that propofol acts on GABA(A) receptors. As assessed by inhibition of the spontaneous firing rate  propofol was 5.6-fold more potent than GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). Potentiation of the propofol effect by other general anesthetics or other drugs was also investigated. When pentobarbital (100 microM) was tested alone on locus coeruleus cells  no change in membrane potential or input resistance was seen and there was only a 20.3+/-7.2% (n=8) inhibition of firing rate; however  in combination with 30 microM propofol  it caused a 6.1-fold greater increase in membrane hyperpolarization and a 9.7-fold greater reduction in input resistance than 30 microM propofol alone. A relatively low concentration of alphaxalone (10 microM)  when tested alone  had little effect on the membrane potential or input resistance and only produced a 46.0+/-8.9% (n=8) inhibition of firing rate; however  in combination with 30 microM propofol  it caused a 9.3-fold greater hyperpolarization and an 8.6-fold greater reduction in input resistance compared with 30 microM propofol alone. In contrast  diazepam caused no potentiation of either propofol- or GABA-induced responses. Our data also indicate that locus coeruleus neuron GABA(A) receptors possess distinctive pharmacologic characteristics  such as blocking of the propofol effects by zinc and insensitivity to diazepam and the direct action of pentobarbital. On the basis of these pharmacologic properties  we suggest that locus coeruleus neuron GABA(A) receptors do not contain the gamma subunit."
